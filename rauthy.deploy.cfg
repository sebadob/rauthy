### !!! CAUTION !!!
###
### This config is incomplete and only exists to provide values that will
### most probably be interesting for testing out Rauthy and to make the
### container image start without any configuration at all during evaluation.
###
### You can find a complete example with all existing config values in the book:
### https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/config/config.html
###
### DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION WITHOUT MODIFICATION
###
### Especially the `ENC_KEYS` should never be used in production. These are
### Only hardcoded for demo purposes!

############ DATABASE ###############
#####################################

# The database driver will be chosen at runtime depending on the given DATABASE_URL format. Examples:
# Sqlite: 'sqlite:data/rauthy.db' or 'sqlite::memory:'
# Postgres: 'postgresql://User:PasswordWithoutSpecialCharacters@localhost:5432/DatabaseName'
#
# NOTE: The password in this case should be alphanumeric. Special characters could cause problems in the connection
# string.
#
# CAUTION: To make the automatic migrations work with Postgres15, when you do not want to just use the `postgres` user,
# You need to have a user with the same name as the DB / schema. For instance, the following would work without
# granting extra access to the `public` schema which is disabled by default since PG15:
# database: rauthy
# user: rauthy
# schema: rauthy with owner rauthy
#
#DATABASE_URL=sqlite:data/rauthy.db

###### ENCRYPTION / HASHING #########
#####################################

# You need to define at least one valid encryption key.
# These keys are used in various places, like for instance
# encrypting confidential client secrets in the database, or
# encryption cookies, and so on.
#
# The format must match:
# ENC_KEYS="
# q6u26onRvXVG4427/M0NFQzhSSldCY01rckJNa1JYZ3g2NUFtSnNOVGdoU0E=

# "
#
# The first part until the first `/` is the key ID.
# The ID must match '[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,20}'
#
# The key itself begins after the first `/` has been found.
# The key must be exactly 32 bytes long, encoded as base64.
#
# You can find a more detailed explanation on how to generate
# keys in the documentation:
# 1. https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/getting_started/k8s.html#create-and-apply-secrets
# 2. https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/config/encryption.html
#
# You can provide multiple keys to make things like key
# rotation work. Be careful with removing old keys. Make sure
# that all secrets have been migrated beforehand.
# You can find a utility in the Admin UI to do this for you.

# The E-Mail address event notifications should be sent to

# - critical
# default: 'notice'
#EVENT_NOTIFY_LEVEL_EMAIL=notice

# Matrix variables for event notifications.
# `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_ID` and `EVENT_MATRIX_ROOM_ID` are mandatory.
# Depending on your Matrix setup, additionally one of
# `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_PASSWORD` is needed.
# If you log in to Matrix with User + Password, you may use `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_PASSWORD`.
# If you log in via OIDC SSO (or just want to use a session token you can revoke),
# you should provide `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
# If both are given, the `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` will be preferred.
#
# If left empty, no messages will be sent to Slack.

#LOG_LEVEL=info

# This is a special config which allows the configuration of customized access logs.
# These logs will be logged with each request in addition to the normal LOG_LEVEL logs.
# The following values are valid:
# - Debug
#   CAUTION: The Debug setting logs every information available to the middleware which includes SENSITIVE HEADERS
#   DO NOT use the Debug level in a working production environment!
# - Verbose
#   Verbose logging without headers - generates huge outputs
# - Basic
#   Logs access to all endpoints apart from the Frontend ones which all js, css, ...
# - Modifying
#   Logs only requests to modifying endpoints and skips all GET
# - Off
# default: Modifying

# The Public URL of the whole deployment
# The LISTEN_SCHEME + PUB_URL must match the HTTP ORIGIN HEADER later on, which is especially important when running
# rauthy behind a reverse proxy. In case of a non-standard port (80/443), you need to add the port to the PUB_URL

# If the Swagger UI should be served externally as well. This makes the link in the Admin UI work.
#
# CAUTION: The Swagger UI is open and does not require any login to be seen!

# The Cache lifetime for additional Webauthn Data like auth codes and so on. Should not be lower than WEBAUTHN_REQ_EXP.
# The value is in seconds (default: 90)
WEBAUTHN_DATA_EXP=90

# With webauthn enabled for a user, he needs to enter username / password on a new system. If these credentials are
# verified, rauthy will set an additional cookie, which will determine how long the user can then use only (safe)
# MFA passwordless webauthn login with yubikeys, apple touch id, windows hello, ... until he needs to verify his
# credentials again.
# Passwordless login is generally much safer than logging in with a password. But sometimes it is possible, that the
# Webauthn devices do not force the user to include a second factor, which in that case would be a single factor login
# again. That is why we should ask for the original password in addition once in a while to set the cookie.
# The value is in hours (default: 2160)
WEBAUTHN_RENEW_EXP=2160

# This feature can be set to 'true' to force User verification during the Webauthn ceremony.
# UV will be true, if the user does not only need to verify its presence by touching the key, but by also providing
# proof that he knows (or is) some secret via a PIN or biometric key for instance.
# With UV, we have a true MFA scenario where UV == false (user presence only) would be a 2FA scenario (with password).
# Be careful with this option, since Android and some special combinations of OS + browser to not support UV yet.
