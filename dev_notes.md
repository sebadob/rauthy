# TODO List

## CURRENT WORK

TODO before next release:

- update secrets migration

## Stage 1 - essentials

[x] finished

## Stage 2 - features - do before v1.0.0

- check if `REFRESH_TOKEN_GRACE_TIME` can be dropped with Hiqlite

## Stage 3 - Possible nice to haves

- impl experimental `dilithium` alg for token signing to become quantum safe
- custom event listener template to build own implementation?
