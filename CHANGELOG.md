### Changes

#### TLS Hot-Reload

Rauthy can not hot-reload TLS Key + Certificates. If started with `server.scheme` set to any `https` value and TLS
certificates are used, Rauthy will watch for file changes on `tls.cert_path` + `tls.key_path` and will do a hot-reload
of the TLS configuration if anything changes. This is a real hot-reload, meaning there is no restarting the server, and
it does it without any interruption in service.

#### OIDC-backed Forward-Auth

In addition to the already existing, very simple `/forward_auth` endpoint, which has limited compatibility, Rauthy now
provides a very much advanced version of it. This new version is not a replacement of the old approach, but an addition.

The already existing endpoint is very simple: It expects a valid JWT token to be present in the `Authorization` header,
parses and validates it, and if it's valid, it returns an HTTP 200 and a 401 otherwise. Depending on
`auth_headers.enable`, it will also append the Forward-Auth headers to the request, which the reverse proxy could inject
into the request sent to the downstream client.

The new version is much improved. It does not work with stateless JWT tokens, but it binds to the Rauthy session. This
makes it possible to revoke access as any time. It can also do proper CSRF checks, validates the client and user
configuration, and it can make everything work without any modification to the client. On auth success, it behaves in
the same way as the already existing endpoint. On invalid though, it will redirect to Rauthys Login, which then again
will do another redirect to a Callback UI and therefore trigger a complete OIDC flow. On the callback page, Rauthy can
now set fully-secured session cookies and do others things like check the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header. This is the most
secure it can get, without modifications to the client. The callback page is exposed by Rauthy itself, and can be
"injected" into the client app at your reverse proxy level, which makes all of this as secure as possible.

You can do this new Forward-Auth for any client, as long as it's configured properly. Rauthy is quite a bit more strict
about the correct client config upfront. This makes it possible to have a few additional safety hooks which will help
you prevent unwanted, invalid reverse proxy config, which can happen very quickly for complex setups.

!!! TODO update the book and provide a link. !!!!

> CAUTION: Even though this is probably the most secure you can get with Forward-Auth, it should still only be the last
> resort, and you should always prefer a native OIDC client implementation, if it exists! If you screw up the reverse
> proxy config, or if an attacker can find a way around your reverse proxy and skip it, all your security will be gone
> immediately.

To help during Forward-Auth setup and making sure you got it right in your environment, the `/auth/v1/whoami` endpoint
has received an update as well. You can now set `access.whoami_headers = true` or use `WHOAMI_HEADERS`. This will make
the `/whoami` endpoint not only return the extracted "real IP", but it will also return all request headers it received.
This will help you make sure your setup is working correctly, if you use `auth_headers`. By default, this is set to
`false`. Depending on your internal network setup, this could expose sensitive headers, if you inject any. It will not
return values for `Cookie` and Rauthy's own CSRF token headers, but all others return will show their raw values.

## v0.30.2

### Changes

#### Hiqlite upgrade

Internally, `hiqlite` was updated to the latest stable version. This brings 2 advantages:

1. `cluster.wal_ignore_lock` has been removed completely. It is not necessary anymore, because `hiqlite` now can do
   proper cross-platform file locking and therefore can resolve all possible situations on its own. It can detect, if
   another `hiqlite` process is currently using an existing WAL directory and also do a proper cleanup / deep integrity
   check after a restart as well.
2. You have 2 additional config variables to configure the listen address for Hiqlites API and Raft server. This solves
   an issue in IPv6-only environments, because it used a hardcoded `0.0.0.0` before. You can now also restrict to a
   specific interface as well, which is beneficial for single instance deployments, or when you have lots of NICs.

```toml
[cluster]
# You can set the listen addresses for both the API and Raft servers.
# These need to somewaht match the definition for the `nodes` above,
# with the difference, that a `node` address can be resolved via DNS,
# while the listen addresses must be IP addresses.
#
# The default for both of these is "0.0.0.0" which makes them listen
# on all interfaces.
# overwritten by: HQL_LISTEN_ADDR_API
listen_addr_api = "0.0.0.0"
# overwritten by: HQL_LISTEN_ADDR_RAFT
listen_addr_raft = "0.0.0.0"
```

#### DB shutdown on unavailable SMTP

If the retries to connect to a configured SMTP server were exceeded, Rauthy panics, which is on purpose. However, the
behavior has been updated slightly and it will now trigger a graceful DB shutdown before it executes the panic, which
is just cleaner overall.

[#1045](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1045)

### Bugfix

- A trigger for Backchannel Logout was missing for `DELETE /sessions/{user_id}`
  [#1031](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1031)
- `state` deserialization validation during `GET /authorize` was too strict in some cases.
  [#1032](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1032)
- The pre-shutdown delay should only be added in HA deployments, not for single instances.
  [#1038](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1038)
- The error messages in case of `webauthn` misconfiguration were not always very helpful.
  [#1040](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1040)

## v0.30.1

### Bugfix

- Fixed the encoding for `EdDSA` public keys. They have changed to b64 encoded DER format during the big JWt rework,
  when it should have been just raw bytes.
  [#1018](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1018)
- Added a short 3-second pre-shutdown delay to smooth out rolling releases inside K8s and also have a bit more headroom
  for bigger in-memory cache's replication
  [#1019](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1019)
- Small CSS fix to match the input width for group prefix login restriction for clients
  [#1020](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1020)
- In HA deployments, when the Leader was killed with an appended but not yet fully commited WAL log, there was a bug
  that made it possible that the log truncate would fail after restart and that the start-, instead of the end-offset
  would be adjusted. This has been fixed in `hiqlite-wal` in combination with a bump in patch version for `openraft`.
  If you run a **HA cluster, you should upgrade immediately**!.

## v0.30.0

### Breaking

#### Configuration Rework

You will need to migrate your whole configuration with this release.

Over the last months, Rauthy got so many new features and config options, that the old approach got a bit messy and
hard to follow. Variable names needed to become longer over time to avoid overlap, and so on. Also, because of the way
the application grew over the last years, configs, single static variables and some snippets existed in many places.

This needed to change.

You can still have a config file and overwrite (most) values via ENV vars, if you like, but at least the bare minimum
must exist as a config file now. Even though ENV var are mostly now a security issue, they are by default not protected
depending on the situation. The whole config file has been converted into a `TOML` file. This makes it possible to have
different dedicated sections, shorter variable names again, and it's easier to organize and comes with an already
existing, basic type-system and we can have arrays and typed primitives out of the box now.

The file has been renamed from `rauthy.cfg` to `config.toml`, and it must follow the `toml` syntax. I created a lookup
table so everyone can easily convert their existing config with not too much work. The new config also is more verbose
in terms of documentation and for each value (when it exists), the overwriting ENV var is mentioned directly above.

In some cases, you cannot overwrite with an ENV var, and in others, you can only do something with an ENV var. The
situations when you can only do something via ENV are the ones, that will require you do remove the var immediately
afterward anyway, like e.g. triggering a `DB_MIGRATE_FROM`, or do a new `HQL_WAL_IGNORE_LOCK`, and so on. But I guess
it will become clear when you take a look at the lookup table. I also tried to make it more clear, which values are
absolutely mandatory to set.

On the long run, this change, even though it was a huge PR with almost 12k lines changed, will make everything easier
to maintain and the code a lot more approachable for newcomers. A nice side effect is, that I also optimized it a bit
so that it requires a little bit less memory.

> If anyone has issues with the config with this update, please open an issue and let me know. I did a lot of testing
> and I think, everything is fine, but that many changed lines make it hard to keep track of everything, even though
> this was necessary.

> This is a tiny one, but the value for `logging.log_level_access` has been changed to all lowercase to match the other
> log level values.

##### Lookup Table ENV var -> TOML value

Here you have the lookup table. When there is a `-` somewhere, it means that either no TOML or ENV var exists in that
situation. The `TOML path` colum contains the parent table and the value name itself. For instance, when it says

```
access.userinfo_strict
access.sec_header_block    
```

It will look like this in the `config.toml`:

```
[access]
userinfo_strict = true
sec_header_block = true
```

For a complete documentation for each value, please take a look at the reference config from the book.

[#991](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/991)

#### SwaggerUI Location Change

The way the SwaggerUI used to work was annoying since the very beginning. Even though it's an open source project, you
usually don't want to have your whole API documentation publicly available. The issue was, that it was hard to work
with the SwaggerUI because of some internals that made it impossible to have much manual control. For this reason, up
until `v0.29`, you had the option to expose it internally only in addition to metrics on the internal HTTP server. This
was very annoying as well, just in another way.

After memory profiling and optimizations lately, I found out that the SwaggerUI internal config has additional issues.
It does a deep clone of the complete dataset instead of using pointers for each additional HTTP worker, which led to
very high memory consumption by default on machines with many cores.

I did a complete rework of the way how it's being served and luckily, in the newer versions you can get manual handles
to the internal data, which finally made it possible to move it out of its location. Instead of being available under
`/docs/v1`, it's now under `/auth/v1/docs`, which makes a lot more sense in the first place. Because it's served
manually, a single instance will be kept in static memory instead of cloning the data into each worker. This improves
memory usage a lot already. The other improvement this made possible, is that Rauthy can finally check the session and
(optionally) only serve it when a valid `rauthy_admin` session was found.

This change made it possible to always have it on the same port while still being able to serve all the different
use cases from before. You can enable or disable it, and you can decide whether it should be public or not. No weird
"internal only" stuff anymore. The config variables are still in the server section and the non-public version is now
fully independent of the metrics server.

```toml
[server]
# Can be set to `true` to enable the Swagger UI.
# This will consume ~13mb of additional memory.
#
# default: false
# overwritten by: SWAGGER_UI_ENABLE
swagger_ui_enable = false

# Can be set to `true` to make the Swagger UI publicly
# available. By default, you can only access it with a
# valid `rauthy_admin` session.
#
# default: false
# overwritten by: SWAGGER_UI_PUBLIC
swagger_ui_public = false
```

#### Type change for `zip` / `postcal_code`

The type for `zip` / `postcal_code` has been changed from an Integer to a String in all locations. This means not only
the Admin + Account Dashboards, but of course also inside the `address` claim for `id_token`s. This change brings
compatibility for countries that use non-numeric postal codes.

### Changes

#### Hiqlite Optimizations

Hiqlite has received lots of optimizations and its version has been integrated in this Rauthy version. The updates were
mainly about stability, especially during cluster rolling-releases in environments like Kubernetes, where the versions
before had some issues with the ephemeral, in-memory Cache Raft state, which could get into a deadlock during a race
condition. This has been fixed completely.

Another thing is that it's now possible to optionally have the Cache Raft state like WAL + Snapshots on disk instead of
in-memory. The on-disk solution is of course quite a bit slower, because it's limited by your disk speed, but the memory
usage will be lower as well. If all of that data is kept in-memory, you basically need 3 times the size of a single
cache value (+1 in WAL logs and +1 in Snapshot, kind of, depending on TTL of course). Writing the state to disk has
other advantages as well. The cache can be rebuilt and you never lose cached data even if the whole cluster went down.
On restart, the whole in-memory cache layer can be rebuilt from WAL + Snapshots.

The next improvement is that `hiqlite` received a fully custom WAL implementation and we can drop `rocksdb` as the WAL
store. `rocksdb` is really good and very fast, but a huge overkill for the job, a very heavyweight dependency and
brings quite a few issues in regard to compilation targets. This feature version still contains code and dependencies
to migrate existing `rocksdb` Log Stores to the new `hiqlite-wal` store, but from the next feature version, we can fully
remove the dependency. Just removing `rocksdb` will reduce the release binary size by ~7MB. On top of that,
`hiqlite-wal` is quite a bit more efficient with your memory at runtime without any sacrifices in throughput.

The new `hiqlite-wal` now also has some mechanisms to try to repair a WAL file and recover records that might have been
corrupted because of a bad crash for instance. `rocksdb` could get into a state where it would be almost impossible to
recover. If you run your Rauthy instance in a container environment, or anywhere where you can guarantee, that no 2nd
Rauthy process might try to access the same data on disk, you probably want to set `HQL_IGNORE_WAL_LOCK=true` now, which
will start and try the repair routine, even if it detects a non-graceful shutdown. It is crucial though that it can
never happen, that another instance is still running accessing the same data. That's what this warning is for in such
a scenario. If you rather have full control and double check in case of an error, leave this value unset. The default
is `false`.
The other new value is `HQL_CACHE_STORAGE_DISK`, which is `true` by default. This will store the WAL + Snapshots for the
in-memory cache on disk and therefore free up that memory. If you would rather have everything in-memory though, set
this value to `false`.

```toml
[cluster]
# Hiqlite WAL files (when not using the `rocksdb` feature) will
# always have a fixed size, even when they are still "empty", to
# reduce disk operations while writing. You can set the WAL size
# in bytes. The default value is 2 MB, while the minimum size is
# 8 kB.
#
# default: 2097152
# overwritten by: HQL_WAL_SIZE
#wal_size = 2097152

# Set to `false` to store Cache WAL files + Snapshots in-memory only.
# If you run a Cluster, a Node can re-sync cache data after a restart.
# However, if you restart too quickly or shut down the whole cluster,
# all your cached data will be gone.
# In-memory only hugegly increases the throughput though, so it
# depends on your needs, what you should prefer.
#
# default: true
# overwritten by: HQL_CACHE_STORAGE_DISK
cache_storage_disk = true

# Can be set to true to start the WAL handler even if the
# `lock.hql` file exists. This may be necessary after a
# crash, when the lock file could not be removed during a
# graceful shutdown.
#
# IMPORTANT: Even though the Database can "heal" itself by
# simply rebuilding from the existing Raft log files without
# even needing to think about it, you may want to only
# set `HQL_WAL_IGNORE_LOCK` when necessary to have more
# control. Depending on the type of crash (whole OS, maybe
# immediate power loss, force killed, ...), it may be the
# case that the WAL files + metadata could not be synced
# to disk properly and that quite a bit of data is lost.
#
# In such a case, it is usually a better idea to delete
# the whole volume and let the broken node rebuild from
# other healthy cluster members, just to be sure.
#
# However, you can decide to ignore the lock file and start
# anyway. But you must be 100% sure, that no orphaned
# process is still running and accessing the WAL files!
#
# default: false
# overwritten by: HQL_WAL_IGNORE_LOCK
wal_ignore_lock = false
```

And if all of this was not enough yet, I was able to improve the overall throughput of `hiqlite` by ~30%. For more
information, take at the [Hiqlite Repo](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) directly.

#### Default for `HTTP_WORKERS` changed

The default value for `HTTP_WORKERS` has been changed. Even though you probably almost always want to set this value
manually in production, especially when running your instance on a huge underlying host, the default has been tuned to
fit smaller hosts a bit better. Here is the new description in the config:

```toml
[server]
# Limits the amount of HTTP worker threads. This value
# heavily impacts memory usage, even in idle. The default
# values are:
# - less than 4 CPU cores -> 1
# - 4+ cores -> max(2, cores - MAX_HASH_THREADS - reserve)
#   where `reserve` is 2 when `HIQLITE=true` and 1 otherwise.
#
# CAUTION: If you run your instance on a big underlying host,
# you almost always want to manually set an appropriate
# value. Rauthy can only see all available cores and not any
# possibly set container limits. This means if it runs inside
# a container on something like a 96 core host, Rauthy will
# by default spawn very many threads.
#
# overwritten by: HTTP_WORKERS
http_workers = 1
```

[#975](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/975)

#### Early `panic` in case of misconfiguration

Most lazy static config variables are now being triggered at the very start of the application. This brings two
benefits:

1. If you have any issues in your config, it will panic and error early, instead of "some time later" when this value
   is used for the first time.
2. It will make the start of the Heap way more compact, because all values will align perfectly, and therefore reduce
   memory fragmentation a little bit.

[#969](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/969)

#### Restrict client login by group prefix

In addition to the already existing "Force MFA" switch for each client, which will fore users to have MFA enabled, you
can now also restrict the login to each client by an additional group prefix, just like it has been added for SCIM syncs
recently.

For instance, if you have groups like `app:admin` and `app:user`, you can restrict the client with the prefix `app:`,
which will only allow users assigned to one of these groups to do the login.

Usually, such decisions are done on the client side, depending on the claims in the tokens, because it's a lot more
powerful and roles can be assigned properly, and so on. However, not all client apps support claim restrictions. In
these cases, you can now do it on Rauthys side, or maybe just in addition to provide a better UX, because the user will
get the error message during Rauthys login already and not after the token was exchanged with the client.

[#952](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/952)

#### Less strict group names

Group names can now contain uppercase letters and spaces.

[#1012](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1012)

#### User-Editable custom attributes

User attributes can now be set to be user-editable. A new section has been added to the account dashboard which shows
these user-editable attributes (if any exist), and the user can modify them without the need of an admin.

CAUTION: Setting an attribute to be user-editable is a one-way operation and cannot be reverted! The reason is, that
user inputs are always unverified and cannot be trusted, and these attributes MUST NEVER be used in any context of
authn / authz on clients. To avoid the possibility of leaking, unvalidated inputs, once an attribute was user-editable,
it can never be changed back, because you cannot trust the existing values at that point. This should act as a
safety-net for admins.

[#964](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/964)

#### Default values for custom attributes

You can now define a default value for each custom attribute. If the value is not set for a user, the default will be
added to token claims. This makes it possible to set things like default storage quotas for all users via a custom
attribute, and still allows to overwrite them. It is probably the most powerful, when you can so modify many users at
once, because it resolves dynamically during token creation and does not need an update for each single user.

[#958](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/958)

#### User account type in Admin UI

The user account type is now also being shown in the Admin UI, just like it is in the account dashboard. With this
update, Admins can see which accounts are federated and to which upstream auth provider they are linked.

[#960](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/960)

#### Custom JWT implementation

Do be more flexible and more efficient, the external dependency for generating JWT tokens has been dropped in favor of
a new, fully custom implementation. This is a lot more light weight, more efficient, and makes Rauthy independent for
things like PQC algorithms / FIPS 204 in the future. This change alone dropped 21 external dependencies in exchange for
only a few hundred lines of code in comparison to the old setup.

To avoid possible resource exhaustion attacks on the token introspection and userinfo endpoints, the token size (in
characters) is now limited to 4096. This is more than double the amount of an RS512 signed `id_token` with more than
only the default values, so you should never have any problems reaching the limit. Theoretically, it is of course
possible, so you get a new config variable to tune this:

```toml
[access]
# Sets the limit in characters for the maximum JWT token length that
# will be accepted when validating it. The default of 4096 is high
# enough that you should never worry about this value. A typical
# `id_token` with quite a few additional custom attributes and scopes,
# signed with RS512, will usually be below 2000 characters.
#
# Only if you create very big tokens and you get errors on the
# `/userinfo` for instance, you might want to increase this value.
# Otherwise, don't worry about it.
#
# default: 4096
# overwritten by: TOKEN_LEN_LIMIT
token_len_limit = 4096
```

[#941](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/941)

#### IP Blacklisting Rework

The IP blacklisting has been reworked. This was done via listen / notify and an instance-local thread, that manages
all blacklisted IPs purely in memory. We usually do not want to trigger any DB writes in such a case to keep the work
as low a possible in case of a DDoS for instance.

However, this old design was from a time when Hiqlite did not even exist yet. The latest version brings distributed
counters, which made it possible to easily push blacklisted IPs into the Hiqlite caching layer. In combination with
another new feature in the latest Hiqlite, which is an optionally persistent WAL + Snapshot on disk for the Cache as
well (enabled by default), you can now have blacklisted IPs in memory for very fast access, while still being able to
persist them in a way, that the full in-memory cache can be rebuilt after a restart.

Pushing this logic into Hiqlite removes a maintenance burden from the Rauthy code. It exists inside Hiqlite anyway
already.

[#985](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/985)

#### `PATCH` is possible on `/users/{id}`

The user modification endpoint now provides a `PATCH` operation, which the Admin UI user config uses by default. It will
only update the values, that actually have been changed in the UI. This reduces the possibility of overwriting values
that have been modified by the user via the account dashboard in the exact same moment.

[#951](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/951)

#### `jemalloc` feature flag

Rauthy can optionally be compiled with the `jemalloc` feature flag, which will exchange the glibc `malloc` for
`jemalloc`. It avoids memory fragmentation over time and is a lot more performant. You can also adjust it to match your
workloads and the default tuning will probably be aimed at being efficient. However, if you run a Rauthy instance with
thousands or even millions of users, you can custom-compile a version with optimized tuning, which will use more memory,
but handle this many concurrent allocations better. Take a look at the book for tuning advise.

The `jemalloc` feature flag will be enabled by default from this version on.

[#949](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/949)

#### Rauthy theme as fallback

The custom theme you apply for the `rauthy` client will now be used as a fallback for all other clients, when they don't
have their own custom values.

[#982](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/982)

#### Dedicated Password Reset Request Page

A link to a dedicated password reset request page has been added to password reset E-Mails. This helps users request a
new magic link quickly when they have an expired one for a password reset in their inbox.

[#1011](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/1011)

#### Production Init Hardening

To harden the production initialization of the database for a fresh instance a bit more, the user ID for the very first
initial admin account is being re-generated randomly. In combination with `bootstrap.admin_email`, this makes it now
100% impossible to guess any value for a possibly existing default admin for any Rauthy instance.

[#983](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/983)

#### Memory optimizations

All `derive` impl's on all API types have been checked and quite a lot of unnecessary `derive`s have been removed (were
e.g. only necessary during development / testing). This is a small optimization regarding release compile-time and
binary size. Additionally, lots of other small improvements have been made all over the code to reduce the number of
overall memory allocations in general.

[#956](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/956)
[#968](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/968)

### Bugfix

- The legacy Rauthy placeholder logo was not removed from the `hiqlite` DB migrations for fresh instances
  [#942](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/942)
- Some mobile browsers started failing recently because of some issue with the PKCE challenge generation. The external
  dependency for this has been dropped in favor of a custom implementation.
  [#953](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/953)
- `user.federation_uid` was saved as an escaped JSON string inside the DB instead of as a raw String directly. This was
  not an issue on it's own, because during login, both the escaped values were compared, but it didn't look good.
  [#962](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/962)
- The default value for the `SMTP_FROM` was changed from `rauthy@localhost.de` to just `rauthy@localhost`.
  [#963](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/963)
- The `state` encoding during `/authorize` was broken in some situations, because the urlencoding was removed in some
  situations, when this param should be sent back to the client unchanged.
  [#980](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/980)

## v0.29.4

### Changes

#### Custom Attributes via SCIM

Rauthy's SCIM functionality now also adds custom user attributes. These will be added, just like inside the `id_token`
claims, under `custom: *` as JSON values. These will be added only if the client should receive these attributes
defined via the allowed `scope`s.

This is a non-RFC value, but it should be ignored by any client, that does not understand the `custom` field. While the
`rauthy-client` has been released with a new version in the meantime, its implementation gives you access to custom
attributes, if some exist.

[#936](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/936)

### Bugfix

- It was possible, that Rauthy tried to sync groups via SCIM even if group syncing has been disabled.
  [#936](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/936)
- The legacy Rauthy logo showed up at the login page in versions `0.29.0` - `0.29.3` for fresh Hiqlite deployments. This
  was due to a missing, permanent database migration that removes the old logo. This was shadowed by the manual version
  migration queries that existed during the `0.28` release. This patch version has a programmatic query and will add
  a permanent migration with the `0.30` release to not introduce breaking changes with a patch level.
  [#943](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/943)

## v0.29.3

### Bugfix

- `v0.29.2`s fix for the HTTP 302 instead of 200 on `/logout` broke the logout from the UI without additional
  `id_token_hint`.
  [#930](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/930)
- Form validation for Upstream Auth Provider config did not set some fields to required under certain conditions and
  would therefore return the backend validation error instead of a nicer way of handling it.
  [#931](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/931)
- Fixed another DB migration query between Hiqlite and Postgres.
  [#932](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/932)

## v0.29.2

### Bugfix

- DB Migrations between Hiqlite and Postgres have not been working as expected since database driver and query reworks
  with `v0.29`.
  [#919](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/919)
- Front-Channel Logout returned HTTP 200 instead of 302 for auto-redirect under certain conditions.
  [#920](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/920)

## v0.29.1

### Bugfix

- Because of the default admin renaming with `0.29.0`, the 2 test admin accounts have not been deleted when starting up
  a new production instance.
  [#909](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/909)
- Error logs with an invalid `rauthy.cfg` have been emitted as tracing logs instead of `eprintln`, when logging was not
  initialized yet.
  [#910](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/910)
- Because of the new session validation rework and additional safety-nets, a login was impossible when
  `SESSION_VALIDATE_IP=false`
  [#911](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/911)

## v0.29.0

### Breaking

#### Postgres: `sqlx` dropped in favor of `tokio-postgres`

Internally, quite a big has happened. `sqlx` has been completely dropped in favor of `tokio-postgres` in combination
with some other dependencies. This solved a few issues.

`sqlx` has been blocking updates quite a few times in the past. It pulls in a huge amount of dependencies, even if they
are not used, which often block other crates. It's also pretty slow with updates, which means you might be forced to
stick with older versions for several months, and it has some other limitations I don't like.

Even though the compile-time checked queries are the best feature of `sqlx`, they also produced a lot of issues and
confusion when other people were trying to build from source, and so on.

The bonus for everyone not working with the code directly is, that `tokio-postgres` has about half the latency of `sqlx`
in my testing.

The breaking changes that comes with this internal change is actually a good one:

You don't specify the `DATABASE_URL` like before. `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_MAX_CONN` have been completely removed.
Instead, you now have separate config vars for each part of the URL. This removes the limitation that you could only
have alphanumeric characters inside your password (otherwise the URL would be invalid).

One additional thing is, that `sqlx` silently ignored TLS certificate validation if it failed, which is actually a
pretty bad behavior. If you are running a Postgres with self-signed certificates, you need to explicitly allow this.

You now need to provide the following values, if you are using Postgres:

```
# If you set `HIQLITE=false` and want to use Postgres as your database,
# you need to set the following variables:
PG_HOST=
# default: 5432
#PG_PORT=5432
PG_USER=
PG_PASSWORD=
# default: rauthy
#PG_DB_NAME=rauthy

# If your database uses a self-signed certificate, which cannot
# be verified, you might want to set this to `true`.
# default: false
#PG_TLS_NO_VERIFY=false

# Max DB connections for the Postgres pool.
# default: 20
#PG_MAX_CONN=20
```

**CAUTION:** This is a pretty big change, because existing `sqlx` migrations will be converted manually. Just to be
safe, you should probably do a database backup before starting `v0.29`!

[#822](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/822)

#### Default Admin change

The default admin has been changed from `admin@localhost.de` to just `admin@localhost`. This is due to the fact that
`localhost.de` is a real domain with a valid TLD and it could introduce issues, if these users exist on a Rauthy
instance.

If you still had an `admin@localhost.de` around in your database, this will also be changed even for an existing
deployment! You will see a `warn!` logging during the whole `v0.29` release to make you aware of this. After the new
version has been started up, your default admin will be `admin@localhost`.

[#866](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/866)

#### Additional PoW requirements

If you have been providing your own, custom login UI, be aware of the fact that the `LoginRequest` +
`ProviderLoginRequest` now require a solved PoW inside the request body. For further information about this, see the
notes down below -> *Defense in depth*;

[#883](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/883)

#### Internal Metrics now opt-in

The internal `/metrics` HTTP server is not used by most people, but it has been enabled by default, while using ~10mb
of memory in idle and adding the overhead to each API request that metrics are actually collected internally. For this
reason, the internal metrics (and therefore also internal Swagger UI) are not opt-in instead of opt-out. If you are
using prometheus metrics right now, make sure that you explicitly set

```
METRICS_ENABLE=true
```

[#876](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/876)

#### Removed Custom CA from Auth Providers

The custom root CA option has been removed from Upstream Auth Providers. This was due to performance and efficiency
optimizations. There is a new global HTTP client (mentioned below) which will handle custom root CAs and will be used
for auth providers as well.

If you are currently using an upstream auth provider with a custom root CA, make sure to add this CA to
`HTTP_CUST_ROOT_CA_BUNDLE` as mentioned further down below`

### Changes

#### OpenID Connect Backchannel Logout

Rauthy now supports [OpenID Connect Backchannel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html).

If downstream clients support it, you can now provide a `backchannel_logout_uri` in the config view via the Admin UI.
Rauthy itself can act as a downstream client for an upstream as well. The default `/auth/v1/oidc/logout` endpoint now
optionally accepts the `logout_token` and will propagate Backchannel Logouts, if the token is actually coming from a
valid, configured upstream auth provider.  
Backchannel Logouts will of course also be triggered in other situations like forced session invalidation by an admin,
user expiration, or deletion, and so on.

The feature can be seen as in beta state now. Everything has been implemented following the RFC and basic integration
tests exist as well. However, to catch some weird edge cases, it needs testing in the real world as well. If you have
any problems using it, please open an issue about it.

There are some new config variables as well:

```
#####################################
######## BACKCHANNEL LOGOUT #########
#####################################

# The maximum amount of retries made for a failed backchannel logout.
# Failed backchannel logouts will be retried every 60 - 90 seconds
# from all cluster nodes. The timeout between retries is randomized
# to avoid overloading clients. It will be executed on each cluster
# member to increase the chance of a successful logout in case of
# network segmentations.
# default: 100
#BACKCHANNEL_LOGOUT_RETRY_COUNT=100

# Can be set to `true` to allow plain HTTP backchannel
# logout requests.
# default: false
#BACKCHANNEL_DANGER_ALLOW_HTTP=false

# Can be set to `true` to allow insecure HTTPS logout requests.
# This will disable TLS certificate validation.
# default: false
#BACKCHANNEL_DANGER_ALLOW_INSECURE=false

# The lifetime / validity for Logout Tokens in seconds.
# These Logout Tokens are being generated during OIDC
# Backchannel Logout requests to configured clients.
# The token lifetime should be as short as possible and
# at most 120 seconds.
# default: 30
#LOGOUT_TOKEN_LIFETIME=30

# You can allow a clock skew during the validation of
# Logout Tokens, when Rauthy is being used as a client
# for an upstream auth provider that uses backchannel
# logout.
#
# The allowed skew will be in seconds and a value of
# e.g. 5 would mean, that 5 seconds are added to the
# `iat` and `exp` claim validations and expand the range.
#
# default: 5
#LOGOUT_TOKEN_ALLOW_CLOCK_SKEW=5

# The maximum allowed lifetime for Logout Tokens.
# This value is a security check for upstream auth
# providers. If Rauthy receives a Logout Token, it will
# check and validate, that the difference between `iat`
# and `exp` is not greater than LOGOUT_TOKEN_ALLOWED_LIFETIME.
# This means Rauthy will reject Logout Tokens from clients
# with a way too long validity and therefore poor
# implementations. The RFC states that tokens should
# be valid for at most 120 seconds.
# default: 120
#LOGOUT_TOKEN_ALLOWED_LIFETIME=120
```

[#794](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/794)
[#819](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/819)

#### RP Initiated Logout

While implementing OpenID Connect Backchannel Logout, support
for [RP Initiated Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html) has been added as well to
provide a complete package.

[#794](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/794)
[#806](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/806)

#### SCIM

This version brings SCIM support to Rauthy.

You can define a custom SCIM base uri per client. The client must support SCIM v2 and the `filter` parameter. Groups
syncing is optional.

You can also define a group prefix which will act as a filter for the to-be-synced data.
For instance, if you define a prefix of `myapp:`, only the groups starting with it will be synced, like e.g.
`myapp:admin`, `myapp:user`. Additionally, only users that are assigned to at least one of these filtered groups will
by synced, while others are skipped.  
The advantage of this is, let's say you have an application with limited seats, or where each existing user costs a
license (Gitlab Enterprise would be an example), you need to pay for each registered user. If you now split your
users into groups and only your developers need to exist on that instance, you can assign a group like `dev:*` and only
sync the `dev:` groups via SCIM.

The SCIM impl is not integration tested, as this usually requires an external deployment. For the future, the idea is
to implement the client side into the `rauthy-client` and use this for integration testing against itself. However, I
followed the RFC closely and tested all operations manually against https://scim.dev .

Just as for the OIDC Backchannel Logout, this feature can be seen as in beta state now. We need some real world testing
next, but I think it should be just fine.

```
#####################################
############### SCIM ################
#####################################

# If set to `true`, already possibly synced groups / users on a
# SCIM server may be deleted if either sync if disabled further
# down the road.
# Depending on your clients specifically, deleting a group / user
# can have a major impact, like e.g. maybe the user had important
# data inside that application that would be deleted automatically
# as well. Depending on your use case, you may want to handle
# deletions manually.
#
# If set to false, only the `externalId` field would be removed
# for the targeted resources, but they would not be fully deleted.
# This will basically unlink the resource from Rauthy, leaving it
# behind independent.
#
# default: false
#SCIM_SYNC_DELETE_GROUPS=false
#SCIM_SYNC_DELETE_USERS=false

# The maximum amount of retries made for a failed SCIM task.
# Failed tasks will be retried every 60 - 90 seconds from all
# cluster nodes. The timeout between retries is randomized to
# avoid overloading clients. It will be executed on each cluster
# member to increase the chance of a update in case of network
# segmentations.
# default: 100
#SCIM_RETRY_COUNT=100
```

[#666](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/issues/666)

#### Defense in depth

Small improvements have been done in various location inside the code to have additional defense in depth or safety-nets
during maintenance and development.

The `LoginRequest` during `POST /authorize`, as well as the `ProviderLoginRequest` require a
solved [Proof of Work](https://github.com/sebadob/spow) from the frontend now. This is an additional DoS protection, and
it mitigates any automated login checks / brute-force by bots or even tools like burp suite, in addition to the
already existing login rate-limiting.  
As an additional UX optimization, all PoW calculations have been removed from the JS main thread and pushed into a
Web Worker. This keeps the UI responsive, even if you set a higher difficulty which takes a bit longer to compute.

Even though not necessary from a security point of view, the `redirect_uri` during an `authorization_code` flow is
checked multiple times between requests. Rauthy validates the URI at the very first possibility and makes it impossible
to change it during the flow, but additional verification is a nice addition.

To make future maintenance tasks a bit more safe, the session state is being checked in 2 different locations now. This
is a tiny overhead of 1 additional `if` clause, but you get a safety net on all API endpoints.

[#834](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/834)
[#881](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/881)

#### Graceful Client Secret Rotation

To be able to follow security best practices, you can now rotate client secrets gracefully.

Rauthy does not allow multiple client secrets, and up until now, if you generated a new one, the old one would be gone
immediately. Now, when you generate a new secret, you have the option to cache the hash of the current one in-memory.
You can also enter a time between 1 and 24 hours. This makes it possible to rotate secrets as a best practice without
any interruption in service.  
If you however need to generate a new secret because of a leak somewhere, you should of course not enable this option.

[#867](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/867)

#### UI Accessibility

Some minor improvements for the accessibility have been made. For instance, some missing `aria-*` labels have been added
and the colors from the scheme have been switched around slightly in some situations to provide a better contrast out
of the box without giving up the look.

[#861](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/861)
[#862](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/862)

#### Manual Admin-Initiated user init

When an admin created a user manually, it is now possible to initialize this user manually and set a password, even if
the user never used or received the initial password reset E-Mail.

[#815](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/issues/815)

#### Additional CORS headers

Additional CORS headers and validation have been added to a few different endpoints, where it made sense, like e.g.
the `/userinfo` or `/introspect` endpoints. Internally, the Origin header extraction and validation has been simplified
as well to make it a bit easier to maintain.

[#855](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/855)
[#856](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/856)

#### Global HTTP Client

To optimize memory usage a little bit, Rauthy now only uses a global, lazily initialized HTTP client for for outgoing
requests (except for Matrix notifications). This static client makes use of connection pooling and keepalives under the
hood to reduce the overall amount of TLS handshakes and latency during daily operation for a few tasks.

Apart from Matrix event notifications, if you need any custom root CA, you need to add it to this client. You can add
as many as you like, just statically upfront. The dynamic approach from before like for instance for upstream auth
providers had a huge drawback, which was that the client had to be created dynamically for each request depending on
the database state. This was very inefficient and a custom root CA usually changes like every 10 years, so it's not any
issue at all to define them via the configuration.

With these changes, you also have access to way more configuration options for the HTTP client and a whole new section
in the config:

```
#####################################
########### HTTP CLIENT #############
#####################################

## In this section, you can configure the HTTP Client
## that Rauthy uses for all different kind's of tasks,
## like e.g. fetching ephemeral client information,
## remote JWKS, connecting to Upstream Auth Providers,
## or for Slack notifications.
##
## NOTE: The only exception is the Matrix Event
## Notification client, if you have this configured.
## Because of the internal structure of Matrix dependencies,
## this cannot easily re-use the global client!
##
## Rauthy creates a single Lazily Initialized instance
## with connection pooling to reduce the amount of TLS
## handshakes necessary, especially during high traffic.

# The connect timeout in seconds for new connections.
# default: 10
#HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10

# The total request timeout in seconds for all outgoing
# requests.
# default: 10
#HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=10

# Set the min TLS version for all outgoing connections.
# Allowed values: '1.3', '1.2', '1.1', '1.0'
# default: 1.3
#HTTP_MIN_TLS=1.3

# The duration in seconds for idle connections in the pool.

#### Additional safeguards for `MIGRATE_DB_FROM`

Rauthy can migrate between Hiqlite and Postgres on the fly. This feature is only supported as long as you do not bump
the major or minor version at the same time. Additional safeguards and checks have been added that prevent you from
doing trying this by accident.

[#811](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/811)

#### Hiqlite optimizations

After `sqlx` was dropped, I could finally upgrade `hiqlite` to the latest version with quite a few improvements in
terms of shutdown speed and stability.

Before, it was possible that you could get into a state with a HA deployment, where the cache leader election got stuck
after a rolling release e.g. inside Kubernetes. This was already fixed in a new version, but `sqlx` blocked the upgrade
for a few months. During that time, I have been able to improve the shutdown behavior even more, and the shutdown time
in HA deployments has been cut in half. For a single instance, it is gone completely now.

Because of many improvements of `hiqlite`s codebase, I was also able to improve the throughput by another ~28%. The
database would never be the bottleneck for a Rauthy deployment (this will always be password hashing, which has to be
slow and expensive on purpose, to make it secure), but it's a nice to have.

#### `SMTP_PORT`

You can now specify a custom `SMTP_PORT` in production. `SMTP_DANGER_INSECURE_PORT` has been dropped in favor of just
`SMTP_PORT`, which will now also be applied on secure connections in production, not just during local development.

[#840](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/840)

#### Latin Extended-B

The `user.given_name`, `user.familiy_name` and `client.name` now also allow characters from the Latin Extended-B.

[#873](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/873)

### Bugfix

- If wrong credentials for the SMTP server have been provided, the optional inner error has been masked.
  [#803](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/803)
- The page title for the user registration page has been broken.
  [#812](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/812)
- A bug in the Admin UI could get you into situations, where you would not see a scrollbar for the user navigation.
  [#869](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/869)

## v0.28.3

### Bugfix

- The new Admin UI has always added an `expires` value during the creation of a new user, even if the checkbox was
  unchecked.
  [#797](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/797)
- It has been possible to construct a situation in which a housekeeping scheduler for expired magic links could have
  been deleting newly registered users.
  [#798](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/798)
  [#799](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/799)

## v0.28.2

### Important

This is a pretty important bugfix update. The 0.28 versions before had an error where the `groups` config component in
the Admin UI has been changed to contain `roles` after the first render. This means, if you have saved a user in the
Admin UI (even without changing groups), the groups might have been changed depending on your setup.

The backend sanitizes any submitted `roles` / `groups` on user updates, so only actually existing values can exist, but
if you had a `roles` combination `groups` with the exact same naming, like e.g. an `admin` role and an `admin` groups,
it could have been possible that a user ends up with a group assignment he should not have. At the same time, a user
might have had some groups removed he had before.

This situation can only occur on users you have updated via the Admin UI with either `0.28.0` or `0.28.1`. You should
**update to `0.28.2` asap and double check group assignments** for your users you may have updated with an earlier
`0.28` version via the Admin UI.

### Bugfix

- Fixes a bug in the Admin UI / Users view where the content of the `groups` config component contained `roles` instead
  of groups.
  [#790](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/790)

## v0.28.1

### Security

#### CVE-2025-29787

Rauthy itself has not been vulnerable, but he `zip` dependency pulled in by the Swagger UI as a 3rd party dependency has
been vulnerable when reading files. `zip` inside the Swagger UI has only been used at build time, never at runtime.
However, the version has been bumped to a non-vulnerable one.

[CVE-2025-29787](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29787)

[#785](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/785)

### Changes

#### Updated Translations

`zh` and `ko` translations have received updates. `ko` is now also available for the Admin UI and has been added to the
`FILTER_LANG_ADMIN` value from the `0.28.0` release.

[#769](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/769)
[#775](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/775)

### Bugfix

- UI: Fixed and updated some translations to make them more clear
  [#779](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/779)
  [#783](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/783)
- UI: The `Allow Insecure TLS` checkbox for upstream auth providers has been shown twice in some situations.
  [#780](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/780)
- UI: The `Invalid Input` message has not been reset in some views and situations.
  [#781](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/781)

## v0.28.0

### Breaking

#### Environment Variable Only Config

If you configured Rauthy via environment variables only, you might have breaking changes with this update.

If a configuration is being made purely via env vars, and a proper `rauthy.cfg` (at least an empty file) is not being
created and mounted inside the container, the application would actually use demo values as long as they are not
overwritten by env vars manually.

To improve the security out of the box, the container setup has been changed and the demo config has a separate
filename, which will only be parsed when `LOCAL_TEST=true` is passed in as an env var before app startup.
Setting this value inside the usual `rauthy.cfg` has no effect.

The insecure local testing values that have been set before (again, with an env vars only setup), can be found here
https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/blob/v0.27.3/rauthy.deploy.cfg for reference, so you can check, if you would have
breaking changes.

If no `rauthy.cfg` is ever being created, default values will be used, and you can configure the application safely
with env vars only. If you decide to use both, env vars will keep on having the higher priority over values set inside
the config file, just like it has been before.

[#763](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/763)

#### Changed header names for session CSRF and password reset tokens

This may concern you, if you have built custom UI parts in front of Rauthy.

The Headers names for the session and password reset CSRF tokens have been changed and now contain a leading `x-`.
This make the API more clean, since custom headers should be marked with a leading `x-`.

- `csrf-token` -> `x-csrf-token`
- `pwd-csrf-token` -> `x-pwd-csrf-token`

[#749](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/749)

#### Custom Client Branding

With the migration to Svelte 5 (mentioned below), the way theming is done has been changed from the ground up in such
a way, that it is not possible to migrate possibly existing custom client branding. This means that you will lose and
need to re-create a possibly existing custom branding with this version.

#### Paginated Users / Sessions

This may only concern you if you are doing direct API calls to `GET` users or sessions on a very big Rauthy instance
in combination with server side pagination. When you added `backwards=true` before, the offset of a single page has
been added automatically in the backend. This is not the case anymore to provide more flexibility with this API. You
need to add the `offset` yourself now while going `backwards`.

[#732](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/732)

### Security

#### CVE-2025-24898

Even though the vulnerable code blocks have not been used directly, the `openssl` and `openssl-sys` dependencies have
been bumped to fix [CVE-2025-24898](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24898).

[#717](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/717)

#### GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99

This could have only been affecting dev environments, not any production build,
but [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) has been fixed by bumping frontend
dependencies.

[#735](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/735)

### Changes

#### Svelte 5 Migration

The whole UI has been migrated to Svelte 5 + Typescript. Many parts and components have been re-written from the ground
up to provide a better DX and maintainability in the future.

This whole migration comes with a lot of changes, most of them under the hood regarding performance and efficiency.
There are so many changes, that it does not make much sense to list them all here, but the TL;DR is:

- The whole UI is now based on Svelte 5 + TS with improved performance.
- The DX and UX has been improved a lot.
- Accessibility has been improved by a huge margin.
- Rauthy now comes with a light and dark mode, even for the custom client branding login site.
- We have a new logo, which makes it a lot easier to identify Rauthy in a tab overview and so on.
- The whole UI is now fully responsive and usable even down to mobile devices.
- The whole design of the UI has been changed in a way that most components and payloads can now be cache infinitely.
- The engine for server side rendering of the static HTML content has been migrated
  from [askama](https://github.com/rinja-rs/askama) to [rinja](https://github.com/rinja-rs/rinja) (based on askama with
  lots of improvements).
- The backend now comes with caching and dynamic pre-compression of all dynamic SSR HTML content.
- The way i18n is done has been changed a lot and moved from the backend into a type-checked frontend file to make
  it a bit easier to get into and provide caching again.
- The admin UI can now be translated as well. The i18n for common user sites and the admin UI are split for reduced
  payloads for most users. Currently, only `en` and `de` exist for the Admin UI, but these can be extended easily in
  the future as soon as someone provides a PR. They are also independent with the only requirement that a common i18n
  must exist before an admin i18n. (Translations for E-Mails are still in the backend of course)
- Part of the state for the Admin UI has been moved into the URL, which makes it possible to copy & paste most links
  and actually end up where you were before.

NOTICE: Since the whole UI has basically been re-written, or at least almost every single line has been touched, the
new UI can be seen as in beta state. If you have any problems with it, please open an issue.

[#642](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/issues/642)

#### User Pictures / Avatars

It is now possible to upload an avatar / picture for each user. This can be done via the account dashboard.

Rauthy uses the term `picture` to match the OIDC RFC spec. If the `scope` during login includes `profile` and the user
has a picture, the `picture` claim will be included in the `id_token` and will contain the URL where the user picture
can be found.
User Picture URLs are "safe" to be used publicly, and they contain 2 cryptographically random secure IDs. This makes it
possible to even make them available without authentication for ease of use. By default, a session / API Key / token
is required to fetch them, but you can opt-out of that.

For storage options, the default is database. This is not ideal and should only be done for small instances with maybe
a few hundred users. They can fill up the database pretty quickly, even though images are optimized after upload, they
will end up somewhere in the range of ~25 - 40kB each.
For single instance deployments, you can use local `file` storage, while for HA deployments, you should probably use
an S3 bucket to do so.

Uploading user pictures can be disabled completely by setting `PICTURE_STORAGE_TYPE=disabled`

The following new config variables are available:

```
#####################################
######### User Pictures #############
#####################################

# The storage type for user pictures.
# By default, they are saved inside the Database, which is not ideal.
# If you only have a couple hundred users, this will be fine, but
# anything larger should use an S3 bucket if available. For single
# instance deployments, file storage to local disk is available
# as well, but this must not be used with multi replica / HA
# deployments.
# Images will ba reduced in size to max 192px on the longest side.
# They most often end up between 25 - 40kB in size.
#
# Available options: db file s3 disabled
# Default: db
#PICTURE_STORAGE_TYPE=db

# If `PICTURE_STORAGE_TYPE=file`, the path where pictures will be
# saved can be changed with this value.
# default: ./pictures
#PICTURE_PATH="./pictures"

# Access values for the S3 bucket if `PICTURE_STORAGE_TYPE=s3`.
# Not needed otherwise.
#PIC_S3_URL=https://s3.example.com
#PIC_S3_BUCKET=my_bucket
#PIC_S3_REGION=example
#PIC_S3_KEY=s3_key
#PIC_S3_SECRET=s3_secret
# default: true
#PIC_S3_PATH_STYLE=true

# Set the upload limit for user picture uploads in MB.
# default: 10
#PICTURE_UPLOAD_LIMIT_MB=10

# By default, user pictures can only be fetched with a valid
# session, an API Key with access to Users + Read, or with a
# valid token for this user. However, depending on where and
# how you are using Rauthy for your user management, you may
# want to make user pictures available publicly without any
# authentication.
#
# User Picture URLs are "safe" in a way that you cannot guess
# a valid URL. You will need to know the User ID + the Picture
# ID. Both values are generated cryptographically secure in the
# backend during creation. The Picture ID will also change
# with every new upload.
#
# default: false
#PICTURE_PUBLIC=false
```

[#743](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/743)

#### Static HTML + prepared queries added to version control

To make it possible to build Rauthy from source in environments like e.g. FreeBSD, all pre-built static HTML files have
been added to version control, even though they are built dynamically each time in release pipelines. Additionally, all
DB queries used by `sqlx` are added to version control as well.

The reason is that the UI cannot be built in certain environments. With these files checked-in, you can build from
source with just `cargo build --release` by having Rust available. You don't need to build the UI or have a Postgres
running anymore, if you only care about building from source.

#### I18n - Korean

Korean has been added to the translations for all user-facing UI parts.
[#670](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/670)

#### Filter I18n UI Languages

Since it is likely that the available translations will expand in the future and you may not need or
want to show all options to the users, because you maybe only have a local / regional deployment, you
can now apply a filter to the Languages that are shown in the UI selector.

```
#####################################
############### I18n ################
#####################################

# Can be set to filter the languages to show in the UI.
# If not set, all available i18n translations will be
# show in the language selector.
# To show only specific ones, provide them here as a
# space-separated value.
#
# Languages for all user-facing pages.
# Available Options: en de zhhans ko
#FILTER_LANG_COMMON="en de zhhans ko"
# Languages for the Admin UI.
# Available Options: en de
#FILTER_LANG_ADMIN="en de"
```

[#748](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/748)

#### Manual `Debug` impls

For types in the background, that hold sensitive data like passwords or client secrets, manual impls for `Debug` have
been added to make sure that no sensitive information can leak into logs with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

CAUTION: If you enable `HQL_LOG_STATEMENTS=true` for DB statement logging, it is guaranteed that you will see sensitive
information in logs sooner or later, so be very careful when using this in production.

[#708](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/708)

### Bugfix

- When using the `MIGRATE_DB_FROM` in combination with a Sqlite DB as base that has been created with
  Rauthy < `v0.20.0`, the migration might fail for you in `v0.27.0` because of an old value in the `config`
  table that might not have been cleaned up properly in some cases.
  [#669](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/685)
- Fixed a regression from v0.27.0 which made it impossible to use `zh-Hans` as a users' language. The deserialization
  of the database value would fail when using Hiqlite.
  [#693](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/693)
- Fixed a bug in the UI - Custom User Attributed: When only a single existing attributed has been deleted, the
  list would not properly update and remove it.
  [#695](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/695)
- Type information has been missing for a few endpoints in the OpenAPI definition, which have been fixed in various
  PRs.
- A bug has been fixed where the `/logout` endpoint did not correctly forward the optional `state`, if it has been
  initiated by a downstream client.
  [#690](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/690)

## v0.27.3

### Changes

#### Upstream Identity Providers

To provide additional compatibility for some upstream providers like Active Directory Federation Severices,
some changes have been applied to Rauthy's behavior.

The first thing is that the HTTP client used for upstream Logins does not force TLS v1.3 anymore, but also allows
TLS v1.2. Both v1.2 and v1.3 are considered being secure by current standards. This is necessary, because some OSes
like Windows Server 2019 do not support TLS 1.3.

The second change is for the way upstream providers are configured. The behavior until now was, that Rauthy added the
client credentials as both Basic Authentication in headers, and in the body for maximum compatibility. However, some
IdP'S (like ADFS for instance) complain about this and only expect it in one place.
To make this happen, there are 2 new fields for the upstream IdP configuration:

- `client_secret_basic: bool`
- `client_secret_post: bool`

These are available as switches in the Admin UI for each upstream provider. To not introduce breaking changes, all
possibly existing configurations will have both options enabled like it has been up until now.

[#659](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/659)

#### Note

Even though this changes the request and response objects on the API, this change is **NOT** being handled as
a breaking change. API clients are forbidden to modify upstream IdPs for security reasons, which means this change
should only affect the Rauthy Admin UI.

#### Gitlab as Upstream IdP

Gitlab is special and does its own, annoying thing to make it usable as an upstream IdP. An issue has been found
when someone tries to log in with no publicly shown email address. In this worst case scenario, a successful
login to Github while retrieving all necessary information (email is mandatory for Rauthy), you need to do 3
different API requests.

This version also makes it possible to log in via Github IdP with an account with only private email addresses.
A different `scope` for the login is necessary to make this possible. The template in the UI has been updated,
but this will not affect existing Github IdP Providers. If you are currently using Github as upstream IdP, please
change the `scope` manually from `read:user` to `user:email`.

[#665](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/665)

### Bugfix

- During the deletion of a custom scope, that has been mapped to only a clients default scopes, but not the
  free ones, the mapping would be skipped during the whole client cleanup and end up being left-over after the
  deletion, which needed a manual cleanup afterward.
  [#663](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/663)

## v0.27.2

### Changes

Even though not recommended at all, it is now possible to opt-out of the `refresh_token` nbf claim, and disable it.

By default, A `refresh_token` will not be valid before `access_token_lifetime - 60 seconds`, but some (bad) client
implementations try to refresh `access_tokens` while they are still valid for a long time. To opt-out, you get a new
config variable:

```
# By default, `refresh_token`s will have an `nbf` claim, making them valid
# at `access_token_lifetime - 60 seconds`. Any usage before this time will
# result in invalidation of not only the token itself, but also all other
# linked sessions and tokens for this user to prevent damage in case a client
# leaked the token by accident.
# However, there are bad / lazy client implementations that do not respect
# either `nbf` in the `refresh_token`, or the `exp` claim in `access_token`
# and will refresh early while the current access_token is still valid.
# This does not only waste resources and time, but also makes it possible
# to have multiple valid `access_token`s at the same time for the same
# session. You should only disable the `nbf` claim if you have a good
# reasons to do so.
# If disabled, the `nbf` claim will still exist, but always set to *now*.
# default: false
DISABLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_NBF=false
```

[#651](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/653)

### Bugfix

The Rauthy deployment could get stuck in Kubernetes when you were running a HA-Cluster with Postgres as your database
of choice. The cache raft re-join had an issue sometimes because of a race condition, which needed a full restart of the
cluster. This has been fixed in [hiqlite-0.3.2](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite/releases/tag/v0.3.2) and the
dependency has been bumped.

## v0.27.1

### Bugfix

With the big migration to [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) under the hood, a bug has been introduced with
`v0.27.0` that made it possible to end up with a `NULL` value for the password policy after an update. Which would
result in errors further down the road after a restart, because the policy could not be read again.

This version fixes the issue itself and checks at startup if the database needs a fix for this issue because of an
already existing `NULL` value. In this case, the default password policy will be inserted correctly at startup.

[#646](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/646)

## v0.27.0

### Breaking

#### Single Container Image

The different versions have been combined into a single container image. The image with the `-lite` extension simply
does not exist anymore and all deployments can be done with just the base image. Since Postgres was the default before,
you need to change your image name when you do not use Postgres as your database, just remove the `-lite`.

#### Dropped `sqlx` SQLite in favor of [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite)

From this version on, Rauthy will not support a default SQLite anymore. Instead, it will use
[Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite), which under the hood uses SQLite again and is another project of mine.

[Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) will bring lots of advantages. It will use a few more resources than a
direct, plain SQLite, but only ~10-15 MB of memory for small instances. In return, you will get higher consistency and
never blocking writes to the database during high traffic. It also reduces the latency for all read statements by a huge
margin compared to the solution before. Rauthy always enables the `dashboard` feature
for [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite), which will be available over the Hiqlite API port / server.

The biggest feature it brings though is the ability to **run a HA cluster without any external dependencies**. You can
use [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) on a single instance and it would "feel" the same as just a SQLite,
but you can also spin up 3 or 5 nodes to get High Availability without the need for an external database. It uses the
Raft algorithm to sync data while still using just a simple SQLite under the hood. The internal design of Hiqlite has
been optimized a lot to provide way higher throughput as you would normally get when you just use a direct connection
to a SQLite file. If you are interested more about the internals, take a look at
the [hiqlite/README.md](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite/blob/main/README.md)
or [hiqlite/ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md).

With these features, Hiqlite will always be the preferred database solution for Rauthy. You should really not spin up
a dedicated Postgres instance just for Rauthy, because it would just use too many resources, which is not necessary.
If you have a Postgres up and running anyway, you can still opt-in to use it.

This was a very big migration and tens of thousands of lines of code has been changed. All tests are passing and a lot
of additional checks have been included. I could not find any leftover issues or errors, but please let me know if you
find something.

If you are using Rauthy with Postgres as database, you don't need to do that much. If however you use SQLite, no
worries, Rauthy can handle the migration for you after adopting a few config variables. Even if you do the
auto-migration from an existing SQLite to Hiqlite, Rauthy will keep the original SQLite file in place for additional
safety, so you don't need to worry about a backup (as long as you set the config correctly of course). The next bigger
release will maybe do cleanup work when everything worked fine for sure, or you can do it manually.

##### New / Changed Config Variables

There are quite a few new config variables and some old ones are gone. What you need to set to migration will be
explained below.

```
#####################################
############# BACKUPS ###############

# When the auto-backup task should run.
# Accepts cron syntax:
# "sec min hour day_of_month month day_of_week year"

# Local backups older than the configured days will be cleaned up after
# the backup cron job.

# Backups older than the configured days will be cleaned up locally
# after each `Client::backup()` and the cron job `HQL_BACKUP_CRON`.

#HQL_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS_LOCAL=3

# If you ever need to restore from a backup, the process is simple.
# 1. Have the cluster shut down. This is probably the case anyway, if
#    you need to restore from a backup.
# 2. Provide the backup file name on S3 storage with the
#    HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE value.
# 3. Start up the cluster again.
# 4. After the restart, make sure to remove the HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE

##### Migration (Postgres)

If you use Rauthy with Postgres and want to keep doing that, the only thing you need to do is to opt-out of Hiqlite.

```
HIQLITE=false
```

##### Migration (SQLite)

If you use Rauthy with SQLite and want to migrate to Hiqlite, you can utilize all the above-mentioned new config
variables, but mandatory are the following ones.

###### Backups

Backups for the internal database work in the same way as before, but because I moved the backup functionality directly
into [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite), the variable names have been changed so they make sense if it is
used in another context.

- `BACKUP_TASK` -> `HQL_BACKUP_CRON`
- `BACKUP_NAME` does not exist anymore, will be chosen automatically depending on the cluster leader name
- `BACKUP_RETENTION_LOCAL` -> `HQL_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS_LOCAL`
- `RESTORE_BACKUP` -> `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE`
- `S3_URL` -> `HQL_S3_URL`
- `S3_REGION` -> `HQL_S3_REGION`
- `S3_PATH_STYLE` -> `HQL_S3_PATH_STYLE`
- `S3_BUCKET` -> `HQL_S3_BUCKET`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY` -> `HQL_S3_KEY`
- `S3_ACCESS_SECRET` -> `HQL_S3_SECRET`

`S3_DANGER_ALLOW_INSECURE` stayed as it is.

`BACKUP_RETENTION_LOCAL` is new, and it will actually handle the backup cleanup on the S3 storage for you,
without defining retention rules for the whole bucket.

###### Hiqlite Dashboard

Rauthy comes with the `dashboard` feature from Hiqlite enabled. If you want to make use of it, you need to set the
password for logging in. This is a static config variable, and it will only be a single password, no users / accounts.
The main idea behind the dashboard is to have debugging capabilities in production, which is usually hard to do with
a SQLite running inside a container.  
You need to generate a random password (at least 16 characters), hash it with Argon2ID, and then base64 encode it.
You can do all this manually, or use the `hiqlite` cli to generate a complete hiqlite config where you copy it from.

**Manual:**

Use an online tool like for instance https://argon2.online to generate an Argon2**ID** hash.
Set the following options:

- Salt: Random
- Parallelism Factor: 2
- Memory Cost: 32
- Iterations: 2
- Hash Length: 32
- Argon2id

Then copy the **Output in Encoded Form** and base64 encode it, for instance using https://www.base64encode.org.

**`hiqlite` cli:**

Currently, you can only install the `hiqlite` cli via `cargo`:

- `cargo install hiqlite --features server`
- `hiqlite generate-config -p YouRandomSecurePasswordAtLeast16Chars`
- grab the password from the config, location written in the output

###### Migration

Unless you specified a custom target path on disk for SQLite(`HQL_DATA_DIR`)) before, you should be good with the
configuration now. If you start up Rauthy now, it will be like a fresh install, which you most probably don't want.
To migrate your current SQLite to Hiqlite at startup, you need to set the `MIGRATE_DB_FROM` once at startup. If you used
the default path before, you need to set:

```
MIGRATE_DB_FROM=sqlite:data/rauthy.db
```

For a custom path, just adopt the value accordingly. This works as well by the way, if you want to migrate from Postgres
to Hiqlite.

**!!! CAUTION !!!**  
You must remove this variable after Rauthy has been started successfully! Otherwise, it would do the migration again
and again with each following restart and therefore remove everything that has happened in between!

[#592](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/592)
[#601](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/601)
[#603](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/603)

#### User Registration - Redirect Hint

As an additional hardening, the open redirect hint for user registrations has been locked down a bit by default.
If you used this feature before, you should update `Client URI`s via the Admin UI, so all possible `redirect_uri`s
you are using will still be considered valid, or opt-out of the additional hardening.

```
# If set to `true`, any validation of the `redirect_uri` provided during
# a user registration will be disabled.
# Clients can use this feature to redirect the user back to their application
# after a successful registration, so instead of ending up in the user
# dashboard, they come back to the client app that initiated the registration.
#
# The given `redirect_uri` will be compared against all registered
# `client_uri`s and will throw an error, if there is no match. However,
# this check will prevent ephemeral clients from using this feature. Only
# if you need it in combination with ephemeral clients, you should
# set this option to `true`. Otherwise it is advised to set the correct
# Client URI in the admin UI. The `redirect_uri` will be allowed if it starts
# with any registered `client_uri`.
#
# default: false
#USER_REG_OPEN_REDIRECT=true
```

#### Optional User Family Name

Since I received quite a few questions and requests regarding the mandatory `family_name` for users, I decided to change
it and make it optional. This change should not affect you in any way if you only consumed `id_token`s, because the
`family_name` inside them has been optional before already. Its existence in the `id_token` depends on allowed and
requested claims.

However, if you used to communicate with the Rauthy API directly, you should be aware of this change. The
`User.family_name` is now optional in all situations.

[#631](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/631)

### Changes

#### Efficiency and speed improvements

During the migration to Hiqlite, I stumbled about a few DB queries in different places that were low haging
fruits for efficiency and speed improvements. I did these while migrating the code base. There were a few ones,
for instance in situations like session invalidation, for password reminder cron jobs, roles / groups / scopes
name updates, and so on. These do not affect the behavior, just the handling under the hood has been improved.

#### SVG Sanitization

Rauthy allows you to upload SVGs as either client or upstream IdP logos. This is an action, that only an authorized
`rauthy_admin` role can do. However, as an additional defense in-depth and protection against an evil admin, Rauthy
now sanitizes all uploaded SVGs, no matter what.

[#615](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/615)
[#616](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/616)

#### Latin-1 Extended A added

The allowed characters for input validation for:

- user `given_name`
- user `family_name`
- client name

have been expanded and will also allow characters from `Latin-1 Extended A`.

[#617](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/617)

### Bugfix

- When Rauthy sent E-Mails, the Name of the name of the recipient has not been set correctly
  [#602](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/602)
- The banner should not be logged as plain text when `LOG_FMT=json` is set
  [#605](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/605)
- When requesting a single user by its ID using an API key, you would get an invalid session error response.
  This was due to an earlier migration a few versions back. The session check should be done only when no API key
  is present to make this request work.
  [#609](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/pull/609)

## 0.26.2

### Bugfix

This patch reverts an unintended change to the `user:group` inside the container images.
This will fix issues with migrations from existing deployments using SQLite with manually managed
volume access rights.

v0.26.0 changed from `scratch` to `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot` as the base image for the final deployment.
The distroless image however sets a user of `65532` by default, while it always has been `10001:10001` before.
The affected versions are

- `0.26.0`
- `0.26.1`

Starting from this release (`0.26.2`), the user inside the container will be the same one as before:

`10001:10001`

## 0.26.1

### Changes

#### Upstream Auth Provider Query Params

Some upstream auth providers need custom query params appended to their authorization endpoint URL.
Rauthy will now accept URLs in the auth provider config with pre-defined query params, as long as they
don't interfere with OIDC default params.

[7dee26a](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/7dee26af0ab757cd80395652fe03f82ffbc2c8bc)

#### Option Log Fmt as JSON

To make automatic parsing of logs possible (to some extent), you now have the ability to change the logging output from
text to json with the following new config variable:

```
# You can change the log output format to JSON, if you set:
# `LOG_FMT=json`.
# Keep in mind, that some logs will include escaped values,
# for instance when `Text` already logs a JSON in debug level.
# Some other logs like an Event for instance will be formatted 
# as Text anyway. If you need to auto-parse events, please consider 
# using an API token and listen ot them actively.
# default: text
#LOG_FMT=text
```

### Bugfix

- With relaxing requirements for password resets for new users, a bug has been introduced that would prevent
  a user from registering an only-passkey account when doing the very first "password reset".

## 0.26.0

### Breaking

#### Deprecated API Routes Removal

The following API routes have been deprecated in the last version and have now been fully removed:

- `/oidc/tokenInfo`
- `/oidc/rotateJwk`

#### Cache Config

The whole `CACHE` section in the config has been changed:

```
#####################################
############## CACHE ################

# when Hiqlite is running as a StatefulSet inside Kubernetes.

#### `/auth/v1/health` Response Change

The response for `/auth/v1/health` has been changed.

If you did not care about the response body, there is nothing to do for you. The body itself returns different values
now:

```rust
struct HealthResponse {
    db_healthy: bool,
    cache_healthy: bool,
}
```

### Changes

#### ZH-Hans Translations

Translations for `ZH-Hans` have been added to Rauthy. These exist in all places other than the Admin UI, just like the
existing ones already.

[fcba3c7](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/fcba3c7cd7bce7e15d911c0f9d7f55f852e7c424)

#### Support for deep-linking client apps like Tauri

Up until v0.25, it was not possible to set the `Allowed Origin` for a client in a way that Rauthy would allow access
for instance from inside a Tauri app. The reason is that Tauri (and most probably others) do not set an HTTP / HTTPS
scheme in the `Origin` header, but something like `tauri://`.

Rauthy has now support for such situations with adjusted validation for the Origin values and a new config variable
to allow specific, additional `Origin` schemes:

```
# To bring support for applications using deep-linking, you can set custom URL
# schemes to be accepted when present in the `Origin` header. For instance, a
# Tauri app would set `tauri://` instead of `https://`.
#
# Provide the value as a space separated list of Strings, like for instance:
# "tauri myapp"
ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_SCHEMES="tauri myapp"
```

[d52f76c](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/d52f76c71b350a08bb67080e620b87bf55d00389)

#### More stable health checks in HA

For HA deployments, the `/health` checks are more stable now.  
The quorum is also checked, which will detect network segmentations. To achieve this and still make it possible to use
the health check in situations like Kubernetes rollouts, a delay has been added, which will simply always return `true`
after a fresh app start. This initial delay make it possible to use the endpoint inside Kubernetes and will not prevent
from scheduling the other nodes. This solves a chicken-and-egg problem.

You usually do not need to care about it, but this value can of course be configured:

```
# Defines the time in seconds after which the `/health` endpoint 
# includes HA quorum checks. The initial delay solves problems 
# like Kubernetes StatefulSet starts that include the health 
# endpoint in the scheduling routine. In these cases, the scheduler 
# will not start other Pods if the first does not become healthy.
# 
# This is a chicken-and-egg problem which the delay solves.
# There is usually no need to adjust this value.
#
# default: 30
#HEALTH_CHECK_DELAY_SECS=30
```

#### Migration to `ruma`

To send out Matrix notifications, Rauthy was using the `matrix-sdk` up until now. This crate however comes with a huge
list of dependencies and at the same time pushes too few updates. I had quite a few issues with it in the past because
it was blocking me from updating other dependencies.

To solve this issue, I decided to drop `matrix-sdk` in favor of `ruma`, which it is using under the hood anyway. With
`ruma`, I needed to do a bit more work myself since it's more low level, but at the same time I was able to reduce the
list of total dependencies Rauthy has by ~90 crates.

This made it possible to finally bump other dependencies and to start the internal switch
from [redhac](https://github.com/sebadob/redhac) to [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) for caching.

**IMPORTANT:**  
If you are using a self-hosted homeserver or anything else than the official `matrix.org` servers for Matrix event
notifications, you must set a newly introduced config variable:

```
# URL of your Matrix server.
# default: https://matrix.org
#EVENT_MATRIX_SERVER_URL=https://matrix.org
```

[0b50376](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/0b5037610d475e7ad6fc0a8bf3b851330088cab1)

#### Internal Migration from `redhac` to `hiqlite`

The internal cache layer has been migrated from [redhac](https://github.com/sebadob/redhac)
to [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite).

A few weeks ago, I started rewriting the whole persistence layer from scratch in a separate project. `redhac` is working
fine, but it has some issues I wanted to get rid of.

- its network layer is way too complicated which makes it very hard to maintain
- there is no "sync from other nodes" functionality, which is not a problem on its own, but leads to the following
- for security reasons, the whole cache is invalidated when a node has a temporary network issue
- it is very sensitive to even short term network issues and leader changes happen too often for my taste

I started the [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) project some time ago to get rid of these things and have
additional features. It is outsourced to make it generally usable in other contexts as well.

This first step will also make it possible to only have a single container image in the future without the need to
decide between Postgres and SQLite via the tag.

[0919767](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/09197670e6491f83a8b739c0f195d4b842abe771)

#### Local Development

The way the container images are built, the builder for the images is built and also the whole `justfile` have been
changed quite a bit. This will not concern you if you are not working with the code.

The way of wrapping and executing everything inside a container, even during local dev, became tedious to maintain,
especially for different architectures and I wanted to get rid of the burden of maintenance, because it did not provide
that many benefits. Postgres and Mailcrab will of course still run in containers, but the code itself for backend and
frontend will be built and executed locally.

The reason I started doing all of this inside containers beforehand was to not need a few additional tool installed
locally to make everything work, but the high maintenance was not worth it in the end. This change now reduced the
size of the Rauthy builder image from 2x ~4.5GB down to 1x ~1.9GB, which already is a big improvement. Additionally,
you don't even need to download the builder image at all when you are not creating a production build, while beforehand
you always needed the builder image in any case.

To encounter the necessary dev tools installation and first time setup, I instead added a new `just` recipe called
`setup` which will do everything necessary, as long as you have the prerequisites available (which you needed before
as well anyway, apart from `npm`). This has been updated in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Bugfix

- The `refresh_token` grant type on the `/token` endpoint did not set the original `auth_time` for the `id_token`, but
  instead calculated it from `now()` each time.
  [aa6e07d](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/aa6e07db8822e72e28329b0ecea52e6113851d4a)

## v0.25.0

### Changes

#### Token Introspection

The introspection endpoint has been fixed in case of the encoding like mentioned in bugfixes.  
Additionally, authorization has been added to this endpoint. It will now make sure that the request also includes
an `AUTHORIZATION` header with either a valid `Bearer JwtToken` or `Basic ClientId:ClientSecret` to prevent
token scanning.

The way of authorization on this endpoint is not really standardized, so you may run into issues with your client
application. If so, you can disable the authentication on this endpoint with

```
# Can be set to `true` to disable authorization on `/oidc/introspect`.
# This should usually never be done, but since the auth on that endpoint is not
# really standardized, you may run into issues with your client app. If so, 
# please open an issue about it.
# default: false
DANGER_DISABLE_INTROSPECT_AUTH=true
```

#### API Routes Normalization

In preparation for a clean v1.0.0, some older API routes have been fixed regarding their casing and naming.
The "current" or old routes and names will be available for exactly one release and will be phased out afterward
to have a smooth migration, just in case someone uses these renamed routes.

- `/oidc/tokenInfo` -> `/oidc/introspect`
- `/oidc/rotateJwk` -> `/oidc/rotate_jwk`

Since I don't like `kebab-case`, most API routes are written in `snake_case`, with 2 exceptions that follow RFC namings:

- `openid-configuration`
- `web-identity`

All the `*info` routes like `userinfo` or `sessioninfo` are not `kebab_case` on purpose, just to match other IdPs and
RFCs a bit more.

There is not a single `camelCase` anymore in the API routes to avoid confusion and issues in situations where you could
for instance mistake an uppercase `I` as a lowercase `l`. The current `camelCase` endpoints only exist for a smoother
migration and will be phased out with the next bigger release.

[107f148](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/107f14807760e56a1671e587fa9b08284589f932)

#### Config Read

The current behavior of reading in config variables was not working as intended.

Rauthy reads the `rauthy.cfg` as a file first and the environment variables afterward. This makes it possible to
configure it in any way you like and even mix and match.  
However, the idea was that any existing variables in the environment should overwrite config variables and therefore
have the higher priority. This was exactly the other way around up until `v0.24.1` and has been fixed now.

How Rauthy parses config variables now correctly:

1. read `rauthy.cfg`
2. read env var
3. all existing env vars will overwrite existing vars from `rauthy.cfg` and therefore have the higher priority

[28b2457](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/28b2457a53bf31163e94a363f2009b811e1b0b76)

### Bugfixes

- The token introspection endpoint was only accepting requests with `Json` data, when it should have instead been
  with `Form` data.

## 0.24.1

The last weeks were mostly for updating the documentation and including all the new features that came to Rauthy in
the last months. Some small things are still missing, but it's almost there.

Apart from that, this is an important update because it fixes some security issues in external dependencies.

### Security

Security issues in external crates have been fixed:

- moderate [matrix-sdk-crypto](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/security/dependabot/54)
- moderate [openssl](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/security/dependabot/55)
- low [vodozemac](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/security/dependabot/53)

### Changes

#### `S3_DANGER_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS` renamed

The config var `S3_DANGER_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS` has been renamed to `S3_DANGER_ALLOW_INSECURE`. This is not a breaking
change right now, because for now Rauthy will accept both versions to not introduce a breaking change, but the
deprecated values will be removed after v0.24.

#### S3 Compatibility

Quite a few internal dependencies have been updated to the latest versions (where it made sense).

One of them was my own [cryptr](https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr). This was using the `rusty-s3` crate beforehand,
which is a nice one when working with S3 storages, but had 2 issues. One of them is that it is using pre-signed URLs.
That is not a flaw in the first place, just a design decision to become network agnostic. The other one was that it
signed the URL in a way that would make the request not compatible with [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/).  
I migrated `cryptr` to my own [s3-simple](https://github.com/sebadob/s3-simple) which solves these issues.

This update brings compatibility with the `garage` s3 storage for Rauthy's S3 backup feature.

### Bugfixes

- Fetching the favicon (and possibly other images) was forbidden because of the new CSRF middleware from some weeks
  ago.
  [76cd728](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/76cd7281fcd1493c9f0cbb208c3fa7ef93814422)
- The UI and the backend had a difference in input validation for `given_name` and `family_name` which could make
  some buttons in the UI get stuck. This has been fixed and the validation for these 2 is the same everywhere and at
  least 1 single character is required now.
  [19d512a](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/19d512ad6ea930467f51d7b704252d3edee7ef1c)

## v0.24.0

Many thousands of lines have been refactored internally to provide better maintainability in the future.
These are not mentioned separately, since they did not introduce anything new. Apart from this, there are only small
changes, but one of them is an important breaking change.

### Breaking

#### `TRUSTED_PROXIES` Config Variable

The new config variable `TRUSTED_PROXIES` introduces a breaking change in some cases.  
If you are running Rauthy with either `PROXY_MODE=true` or with a set `PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME` value, you must add the
`TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your existing config before updating.

This value specifies trusted proxies in the above situation. The reason is that Rauthy extracts the client IP from
the HTTP headers, which could be spoofed if they are used without validating the source. This was not a security issue,
but gave an attacker the ability to blacklist or rate-limit IPs that do not belong to him.

When `PROXY_MODE=true` or set `PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME`, Rauthy will now only accept direct connections from IPs specified
with `TRUSTED_PROXIES` and block all other requests. You can provide a list of CIDRs to have full flexibility for your
deployment.

```
# A `\n` separated list of trusted proxy CIDRs.
# When `PROXY_MODE=true` or `PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME` is set,
# these are mandatory to be able to extract the real client
# IP properly and safely to prevent IP header spoofing.
# All requests with a different source will be blocked.
#TRUSTED_PROXIES="
#192.168.14.0/24
#10.0.0.0/8
#"
```

**Note:**  
Keep in mind, that you must include IPs for direct health checks like for instance inside Kubernetes here,
if they are not being sent via a trusted proxy.

### Features

#### User Registration Domain Blacklisting

If you are using an open user registration without domain restriction, you now have the possibility to blacklist
certain E-Mail provider domains. Even if your registration endpoint allows registrations, this blacklist will be
checked and deny requests with these domains.  
This is mainly useful if you want to prevent malicious E-Mail providers from registering and spamming your database.

```
# If `OPEN_USER_REG=true`, you can blacklist certain domains
# on the open registration endpoint.
# Provide the domains as a `\n` separated list.
#USER_REG_DOMAIN_BLACKLIST="
#example.com
#evil.net
#"
```

[824b109](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/824b109e081f608a9b950483b3da90cde288f6eb)

### Changes

Even though it was not needed so far, the OIDC userinfo endpoint now has a proper `POST` handler in addition to the
existing `GET` to comply with the RFC.  
[05a8793](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/05a8793f013f864db1855ae0ee1c848ec36b9254)

### Bugfixes

- The upstream crate `curve25519-dalek` had a moderate timing variability security issue
  [8bb4069](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/8bb4069e5f22439b08f9f5a51059561007b90af3)

## v0.23.5

### Upstream IdP Locale Fix

This patch fixes a regression from fixing the special characters encoding in upstream IdP JWT tokens. A panic was
possible when the upstream IdP did not include a `locale` in the `id_token`.  
[ea24e7e](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/ea24e7e73f883446a30d7c4f8e38837148da9732)  
[481c9b3](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/481c9b36d3304a2100c2c4906013224c8a5a934f)

## v0.23.4

This is a tiny update, but brings an important bugfix for upstream IdPs.

### Bugfix

A bug has been fixed in case an upstream IdP included special characters inside Strings in the returned JWT token after
a successful user login flow.  
Since JWT tokens should use UNICODE encoding in these cases, it is not possible to do zero-copy deserialization into
Rust UTF8 string slices in that case. This has been fixed in a way, that only when there are existing special
characters,
Rauthy will now do the additional, necessary String allocations for the deserialization process.  
This should fix current issues when logging in via an upstream IdP with special characters inside the E-Mail address for
instance.  
[aa97cb8](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/aa97cb8ba2100f540d48e98aa597c11963c84be3)

Apart from that, there were some minor UX improvements for the Admin UI providers setup page like earlier client side
checking of variables and preventing form submission when some required ones were missing.  
[9a227c9](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/9a227c9297ec326191b3f83eaa45a9f88d8270fb)  
[c89fb7f](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/c89fb7fbacb002a202a8022d8318362ee4d6db73)

## v0.23.3

### Changes

#### Documentation Updates

Updated sections in the documentation for:

- Choose database in Getting Started
- Started a new page for production setup
- Info on Android passkey status
- Encryption section
- Getting Started with Kubernetes

[9f85c77](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/9f85c776666a492eb910c3730676e9fc9c23865d)

#### More strict origin checking

More strict checking and validation for `allowed_origins` has been implemented, when you configure clients. Before,
the regex only checked for the input to be a valid URI, which is not strict enough for validation an origin.  
This should improve the UX and prevents hard to debug bugs, when someone enters an invalid origin.

At the same time, a better visual separation has been added to the Origins / URI section in the UI when configuring
clients.

[8d4e455](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/8d4e455aa9455418aa8fc90612b707da1d72ce57)

#### Small performance optimizations

Small improvements have been made in a lot of places, which resulted in less memory allocations.  
[9144f2a](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/9144f2afad3d1052bc4a927d0cbeaf24c6ea5589)

#### POST `/authorize` simplification

The logic on POST `/authorize` has been simplified internally. The code grew to an over-complicated state with new
features coming in all the time until a point where it was hard to follow. This has been simplified.
This makes the software better maintainable in the future.  
[af0db9d](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/af0db9d0cbe560de327db60e33b61ccf32e33776)

### Bugfix

- add all `/fed_cm/` routes as exceptions to the new CSRF protection middleware
  [360ce46](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/360ce46c19bad81ee60de817f3b3f74f0dd3c408)

  [d2b928a](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/d2b928ad9d34302f0ef2af7830d19cadaf784d5a)
- when a problem with an upstream provider occurs on `/callback`, you will now see the detailed error in the UI
  [8041c95](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/8041c95b57292ac83330c7613698398857864e30)

## v0.23.2

This release brings some very minor features and bugfixes.

### Changes

#### New CSRF protection middleware

CSRF protection was there already without any issues.  
However, a new middleware has been added to the whole routing stack in addition to the existing checks. This provides
another defense in depth. The advantage of the new middleware is, that this can be enforced all the way in the future
after enough testing in parallel.  
If this works fine without any issues, we might get rid of the current way of doing it and only use the new middleware,
which is easier to maintain and to work with.

To not break any existing deployments and make sure I did not forget route exceptions for the new middleware, you can
set it to warn-only mode for this minor release. This option will be removed in future releases though and should only
be a temporary solution:

```
# If set to true, a violation inside the CSRF protection middleware based
# on Sec-* headers will block invalid requests. Usually you always want this
# enabled. You may only set it to false during the first testing phase if you
# experience any issues with an already existing Rauthy deployment.
# In future releases, it will not be possible the disable these blocks.
# default: true
#SEC_HEADER_BLOCK=true
```

[97fedf1](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/97fedf189d54afe9c0d03dbf241ea59248806900)

#### Experimental FedCM support

This is not really considered a new feature, but Rauthy now has experimental support for FedCM in its current state.
This is opt-in and disabled by default. You should not attempt to use it in production because the FedCM implementation
itself still has a few bumps and sharp edges.  
The only reason the experimental support is there is to help smooth out these things and hopefully have FedCM as a
really nice addition. It does not really bring any new possibilities to the table, but it would improve the UX quite a
bit, if it hopefully turns out great.

```
#####################################
############## FED CM ###############
#####################################

## CAUTION: The FedCM is highly experimental at this point!
## Do not attempt to use it in production because it is subject to change
## in the future! The spec is currently a draft and under active development.

# Set to `true` to enable the experimental FedCM.
# default: false
#EXPERIMENTAL_FED_CM_ENABLE=false

# Session lifetime for FedCM in seconds - the session can not be extended
# beyond this time and a new login will be forced.
# default: 2592000
#SESSION_LIFETIME_FED_CM=2592000

# Session timeout for FedCM in seconds
# When a new token / login is requested before this timeout hits the limit,
# the user will be authenticated without prompting for the credentials again.
# This is the value which can extend the session, until it hits its maximum
# lifetime set with _FED_CM.
# default: 259200
#SESSION_TIMEOUT_FED_CM=259200
```

[4689e54](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/4689e54b6193cf62877a75650d74e3bc29e5c8e7)

#### Relaxed validation on ephemeral `client_id`s

The input validation for ephemeral `client_id`s has been relaxed. This now makes it possible to test them with OIDC
playgrounds, which typically generate pretty long testing URLs, which were being rejected for their length beforehand.
Rauthy now accepts URLs of up to 256 characters as `client_id`s.  
[62405bb](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/62405bbad7230f2e3af864b004081a90ab505f6f)

#### Bumped Argon2ID defaults

The default values for the Argon2ID hashing algorithm have been bumped up quite a bit. Rauthy's goal is to be as secure
as possible by default. The old values were quite a bit above the OWASP recommendation, but still way too low imho.
The values will of course still need tuning and adjustment to the target architecture / deployment, but they provide a
way better starting point and can be considered really secure even if not adjusted.

The new defaults are:

```
# M_COST should never be below 32768 in production
ARGON2_M_COST=131072
# T_COST should never be below 1 in production
ARGON2_T_COST=4
# P_COST should never be below 2 in production
ARGON2_P_COST=8
```

[feee23e](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/feee23ee1809bd50416370ccd975e9577a7192e6)

### Bugfixes

- Ephemeral client's now work properly with the `/userinfo` endpoint in strict-validation mode. Their validation is
  simply being skipped at that point, because it does not make much sense to do an `enabled` check at that point.
  [90b0367](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/90b03677ffd3b99372ac9496540449b302af66d5)
- A small bug appeared in the UI after you have added new custom user attributes. Instead of resetting the input
  values to empty strings after the registration, they were set to undefined.
  [ab77595](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/ab775958dec70eee3b2915fe2faa8b4a9816ec2e)
- Because of a bug in the account overview UI, it was not possible to link an already existing account to an upstream
  IdP after the registration.
  [22751ee](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/22751ee6e9b31361d2ee5047a8c8795518d30745)

## v0.23.1

### Features

#### Global Cookie Encryption

All Rauthy cookies (except for the locale) are now encrypted globally inside the whole app by default.  
This is just another defense in depth. The AEAD algorithm makes sure, that you can't tamper with the cookie values,
even if you would try to do it manually.

[4fdb3f2](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/4fdb3f262f128fe803d1542418c06eff08bf210c)

#### Easier extraction of CSRF tokens with external Frontend

If you are in the situation where you run Rauthy behind a reverse proxy on the exact same origin with another app,
and you want to build custom user facing UI parts, you had to retrieve the original HTML for `/authorize` or the
password reset to extract the CSRF token from the HTML content.  
Doing this in tests is fine, but very tedious and wasteful for a production deployment.

For this reason, there are now 2 new possibilities:

- POST `/oidc/session` endpoint to create a session in `Init` state, which will return the cookie and the
  correct CSRF token in a json body
- the password reset link returns a json with a CSRF token instead of an HTML document, if you request it
  with a `Accept: application/json` header

[c37e1f5](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/c37e1f5bc27ebd679c4424ef568a8bae82c523bc)

### Bugfix

- the password expiry reminder E-Mail had a wrong a link to the account page, a left over from older versions
  with `.html` appended
  [d728317](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/d728317ef31e20a117a0ca2a903e767e34c556d4)

## v0.23.0

This release does the first preparations to prepare a future v1.0.0 release.  
Quite a few values have been cleaned up or improved.

### Breaking

#### `rauthy-client` compatibility

If you are using the [rauthy-client](https://crates.io/crates/rauthy-client), you should upgrade to `v0.4.0` before
upgrade Rauthy to `v0.23.0`. Any older client version will not understand the new grant type for the OAuth2
Device Authorization grant.

#### Removal of `UNSAFE_NO_RESET_BINDING` in favor of `PASSWORD_RESET_COOKIE_BINDING`

The config variable `UNSAFE_NO_RESET_BINDING` has been removed in favor of `PASSWORD_RESET_COOKIE_BINDING`.
The logic for this security feature has been reversed. The default behavior until now was to block subsequent
requests to the password reset form if they provided an invalid binding cookie. This created issues for people
that were using evil E-Mail providers. These would scan their users E-Mails and use links inside them.
This link usage however made it impossible for "the real user" to use the link properly, because it has been
used already by its provider.  
In some cases, this hurts the UX more than it is a benefit to the security, so this feature is now an opt-in
hardening instead of opt-out evil provider error fixing.  
Additionally, to improve the UX even further, the additional E-Mail input form has been removed from the password
reset page as well. The security benefits of this were rather small compared to the UX degradation.

[1af7b92](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/1af7b92204a99de4883154055bb3081dc196d759)

#### Removal of `OFFLINE_TOKEN_LIFETIME` config var

`OFFLINE_TOKEN_LIFETIME` has been removed from the config. This variable has been deprecated since a lof
of versions now. The `offline_access` scope was not even allowed via the UI for a long time now, so these offline
tokens were never issued anyway.  
The "new" mechanism Rauthy uses with the switch in the Admin UI to issue / allow refresh tokens for a client
is much more clear, since the `offline_access` scope produces a lot of confusion for people new to OIDC.
From the name, it simply makes no sense that you need to activate `offline_access` to get a refresh token.
Having an option named "allow refresh tokens" is just so much better.
[71db7fe](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/71db7fef18568a599f30cae6e494bba40cb33e7d)

#### Change in `GET /clients/{id}/secret`

If you used the endpoint for retrieving a client secret with an API key before, you need to change the method.
The endpoint works exactly the same, but the method has been changed from a `GET` to a `POST` to request and validate
the additional CSRF token from the Admin UI.  
[72f077f](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/72f077f462e4b28624d101510cfb50b64700e425)

#### Removal of the `Refresh Token` switch in Admin UI

The `Refresh Token` switch for a client config in the Admin UI has been removed.  
The old behavior was misleading and unintuitive, I just got rid of that switch.

If you want to use the refresh flow with a client, the only thing you need to do is to allow the `refresh_token` flow.
You needed to do this before anyway, but in addition enable the switch further down below. So this is not really a
breaking change, but could lead to confusion, if this switch is just gone.  
[2ece6ed](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/2ece6ed6da214b353cc7c9adfbe7904c0f2f6bce)

### Features

#### OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant

This release brings support for the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant.  
On top of the default RFC spec, we have some additional features like optional rate limiting and being able to
do the flow with confidential clients as well. The [rauthy-client](https://crates.io/crates/rauthy-client) has the
basics implemented as well for fetching tokens via the `device_code` flow. An automatic refresh token handler is
on the TODO list though. A small
[example](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/blob/main/rauthy-client/examples/device-code/src/main.rs) exists as well.  
You will find new sections in the account and admin -> user view, where you can see all linked devices, can give
them a friendly name and revoke refresh tokens, if they exist.

#### Dynamic Server Side Search + Pagination

Until now, the Admin UI used client side searching and pagination. This is fine for most endpoints, but
the users can grow quite large depending on the instance while all other endpoints will return rather small
"GET all" data.  
To keep big Rauthy instances with many thousands of users fast and responsive, you can set a threshold for
the total users count at which Rauthy will dynamically switch from client side to server side pagination
and searching for the Admin UI's Users and Sessions page.

```
# Dynamic server side pagination threshold
# If the total users count exceeds this value, Rauthy will dynamically
# change search and pagination for users in the Admin UI from client
# side to server side to not have a degradation in performance.
# default: 1000
SSP_THRESHOLD=1000
```

For smaller instances, keeping it client side will make the UI a bit more responsive and snappy.
For higher user counts, you should switch to do this on the server though to keep the UI fast and not
send huge payloads each time.

#### UX Improvement on Login

The login form now contains a "Home" icon which will appear, if a `client_uri` is registered for the current
client. A user may click this and be redirected to the client, if a login is not desired for whatever reason.
Additionally, if the user registration is configured to be open, a link to the user registration will be shown
at the bottom as well.

#### Unlink Account from Provider

A new button has been introduced to the account view of federated accounts.  
You can now "Unlink" an account from an upstream provider, if you have set it up with at least
a password or passkey before.

[8b1d9a8](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/8b1d9a882b0d4b059f3ed884deaacfcdeb109856)

#### Link Existing Account to Provider

This is the counterpart to the unlink feature from above.
This makes it possible to link an already existing, unlinked user account to an upstream auth provider.
The only condition is a matching `email` claim after successful login. Apart from that, there are quite a few things
going on behind the scenes and you must trigger this provider link from an authorized, valid session from inside your
user account view. This is necessary to prevent account takeovers if an upstream provider has been hacked in some way.

[fdc683c](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/fdc683cec0181e03bb86da1e42fff213715718f0)

#### Bootstrap default Admin in production

You can set environment variables either via `rauthy.cfg`, `.env` or as just an env var during
initial setup in production. This makes it possible to create an admin account with the very first
database setup with a custom E-Mail + Password, instead of the default `admin@localhost.de` with
a random password, which you need to pull from the logs. A single API Key may be bootstrapped as well.

#### New config var `USERINFO_STRICT`

You can now set a new config variable called `USERINFO_STRICT`. If set so true, Rauthy will do additional
validations on the `/userinfo` endpoint and actually revoke (even otherwise still valid) access tokens,
when any user / client / device it has been issued for has been deleted, expired or disabled. The non-strict
mode will simply make sure the token is valid and that the user still exists. The additional validations
will consume more resources because they need 1-2 additional database lookups but will provide more strict
validation and possible earlier token revocation. If you don't need it that strict, and you are resource
constrained, set it to `false`.  
[198e7f9](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/198e7f957c32fef5f0f786b145408f7d625f20ce)

#### `at_hash` in `id_token`

The Rauthy `id_token` now contains the access token hash `at_hash` claim. This is needed for additional
downstream validation, if a client provides both tokens and they are not coming from Rauthy directly.
With the additional validation of the `at_hash` claim, clients can be 100% sure, that a given `id_token`
belongs to a specific `access_token` and has not been swapped out.  
[d506865](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/d506865898e61fce45e5cf4c754ad4300bd37161)

#### Better roles, groups and scopes names

The allowed names for roles, groups and scopes have been adjusted. Rauthy allows names of up to 64 characters
now and containing `:` or `*`. This will make it possible to define custom scopes with names like
`urn:matrix:client:api:guest` or `urn:matrix:client:api:*`.

#### Configurable Cookie Security

Depending on your final deployment, you may want to change the way Rauthy's set's its cookies, for instance if you
want to create your own UI endpoints but still want to be able to communicate with the API.

The default cookie setting has been changed in a way that all cookies will have the `__Host-` prefix now, which provides
the highest level of security. There might be cases where you don't want this and rather have the path restriction to
`/auth` from before, for instance when you host an additional app on the same origin behind a reverse proxy, that should
not be able to read Rauthy's cookies.

And finally, for all Safari users, since Safari does not consider `localhost` to be secure when testing, you can even
set insecure cookies for testing purposes.

```
# You can set different security levels for Rauthy's cookies.
# The safest option would be 'host', but may not be desirable when
# you host an application on the same origin behind a reverse proxy.
# In this case you might want to restrict to 'secure', which will then
# take the COOKIE_PATH from below into account.
# The last option is 'danger-insecure' which really should never be used
# unless you are just testing on localhost and you are using Safari.
#COOKIE_MODE=host

# If set to 'true', Rauthy will bind the cookie to the `/auth` path.
# You may want to change this only for very specific reasons and if
# you are in such a situation, where you need this, you will know it.
# Otherwise don't change this value.
# default: true
#COOKIE_SET_PATH=true
```

[e697389](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/e697389d409dace9cdf866988e833efcd79d4529)

#### Auto-Blacklisting of suspicious requests

Rauthy can now auto-blacklist IP's that do suspicious requests, like for instance:

- /.ssh/
- /.kube/config
- /backup.zip
- /wp-admin/

... and so on.  
Rauthy has a "catch all" API route handler on `/` which looks for these by default.  
By default, IPs from such requests will be blacklisted for 24 hours, but you can of course configure this.

```
# The "catch all" route handler on `/` will compare the request path
# against a hardcoded list of common scan targets from bots and attackers.
# If the path matches any of these targets, the IP will be blacklisted
# preemptively for the set time in minutes.
# You can disable it with setting it to `0`.
# default: 1440
SUSPICIOUS_REQUESTS_BLACKLIST=1440

# This will emit a log with level of warning if a request to `/` has
# been made that has not been caught by any of the usual routes and
# and handlers. Apart from a request to just `/` which will end in
# a redirect to `/auth/v1`, all additional path's will be logged.
# This can help to improve the internal suspicious blocklist in the
# future.
# default: false
SUSPICIOUS_REQUESTS_LOG=flase
```

#### Changes for `/auth/v1/whoami`

The whoami endpoint has been changed. It does not return all headers anymore, because this could possibly leak sensitive
headers in some environments, especially with the new auth headers feature in some situations.  
Instead, it only returns the peer IP that Rauthy extracted for this request. This can be very helpful if you need to
configure the extraction, for instance when you are behind a reverse proxy or CDN.  
[758b31c](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/758b31cb5dc2277a0cc3ec31f15b5de90ff00ea7)

#### New sorting options for users

Users in the Admin UI can now be sorted by their `created_at` or `last_login` timestamp.  
Users that never have logged in will always be at the end of the list, since this value might be `undefined`.

## 0.22.1

### Security

This version fixes a [potential DoS in rustls](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0336.html) which has
been found yesterday.  
[f4d65a6](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/f4d65a6b056183f914075d6047384e2a7a4f0329)

### Features

#### Dedicated `/forward_auth` + Trusted Authn/Authz Headers

In addition to the `/userinfo` endpoint specified in the OIDC spec, Rauthy implements an additional endpoint
specifically for ForwardAuth situations. You can find it at `/auth/v1/oidc/forward_auth` and it can be configured
to append optional Trusted Header with User Information for downstream applications, that do not support OIDC
on their own.

The HeaderNames can be configured to match your environment.
Please keep in mind, that you should only use these, if you legacy application does not support OIDC natively,
because Auth Headers come with a lot of pitfalls, when your environment is not configured properly.

```
# You can enable authn/authz headers which would be added to the response
# of the `/auth/v1/forward_auth` endpoint. With  `AUTH_HEADERS_ENABLE=true`,
# the headers below will be added to authenticated requests. These could
# be used on legacy downstream applications, that don't support OIDC on
# their own.
# However, be careful when using this, since this kind of authn/authz has
# a lot of pitfalls out of the scope of Rauthy.
AUTH_HEADERS_ENABLE=true

# Configure the header names being used for the different values.
# You can change them to your needs, if you cannot easily change your
# downstream apps.
# default: x-forwarded-user
AUTH_HEADER_USER=x-forwarded-user
# default: x-forwarded-user-roles
AUTH_HEADER_ROLES=x-forwarded-user-roles
# default: x-forwarded-user-groups
AUTH_HEADER_GROUPS=x-forwarded-user-groups
# default: x-forwarded-user-email
AUTH_HEADER_EMAIL=x-forwarded-user-email
# default: x-forwarded-user-email-verified
AUTH_HEADER_EMAIL_VERIFIED=x-forwarded-user-email-verified
# default: x-forwarded-user-family-name
AUTH_HEADER_FAMILY_NAME=x-forwarded-user-family-name
# default: x-forwarded-user-given-name
AUTH_HEADER_GIVEN_NAME=x-forwarded-user-given-name
# default: x-forwarded-user-mfa
AUTH_HEADER_MFA=x-forwarded-user-mfa
```

### Bugfixes

- allow CORS requests for the GET PoW and the user sign up endpoint's to make it possible to build a custom UI without
  having a server side. At the same time, the method for requesting a PoW **has been changed from `GET` to `POST`**.
  This change has been done because even though only in-memory, a request would create data in the backend, which should
  never be done by a `GET`.
  Technically, this is a breaking change, but since it has only been available from the Rauthy UI itself because of the
  CORS header setting, I decided to only bump the patch, not the minor version.
  [e4d935f](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/e4d935f7b51459031a37fb2ec2eb9952bc278f2e)

## v0.22.0

### Breaking

There is one breaking change, which could not have been avoided.  
Because of a complete rewrite of the logic how custom client logos (uploaded via
`Admin UI -> Clients -> Client Config -> Branding`), you will loose custom logos uploaded in the past for a client.
The reason is pretty simple. Just take a look at `Auto Image Optimization` below.

Apart from this, quite a few small internal improvements have been made to make life easier for developers and new
contributors. These changes are not listed in the release notes.

### Changes

#### Upstream Auth Providers

Rauthy v0.22.0 brings (beta) support for upstream authentication providers.  
This is a huge thing. It will basically allow you to set up things like *Sign In with Github* into Rauthy. You could use
your Github account for signup and login, and manage custom groups, scopes, and so on for the users on Rauthy. This
simplifies the whole onboarding and login for normal users a lot.

You can add as many auth providers as you like. They are not statically configured, but actually configurable via the
Admin UI. A user account can only be bound to one auth provider though for security reasons. Additionally, when a user
already exists inside Rauthy's DB, was not linked to an upstream provider and then tries a login but produces an email
conflict, the login will be rejected. It must be handled this way, because Rauthy can not know for sure, if the upstream
email was actually been verified. If this is not the case, simply accepting this login could lead to account takeover,
which is why this will not allow the user to login in that case.  
The only absolutely mandatory information, that Rauthy needs from an upstream provider, is an `email` claim in either
the `id_token` or as response from the userinfo endpoint. If it cannot find any `name` / `given_name` / `family_name`,
it will simply insert `N/A` as values there. The user will get a warning on his next values update to provide that
information.

The supported features (so far) are:

- auto OpenID Connect metadata discovery
- accept invalid TLS certs for upstream clients, for instance inside self-hosted environments
- provide a root certificate for an upstream client for the same reason as above
- choose a template for the config (currently Google and Github exist)
- fully customized endpoint configuration if the provider does not support auto-lookup
- optional mfa claim mapping by providing a json parse regex:  
  If the upstream provider returns information about if the user has actually done at least a 2FA sign in, Rauthy can
  extract this information dynamically from the returned JSON. For instance, Rauthy itself will add an `amr` claim to
  the `id_token` and you can find a value with `mfa` inside it, if the user has done an MFA login.  
  Github returns this information as well (which has been added to the template).
- optional `rauthy_admin` claim mapping:
  If you want to allow full rauthy admin access for a user depending on some value returned by the upstream provider,
  you can do a mapping just like for the mfa claim above.
- upload a logo for upstream providers
  Rauthy does not (and never will do) an automatic logo download from a provider, because this logo will be shown on the
  login page and must be trusted. However, if Rauthy would download any arbitrary logo from a provider, this could
  lead to code injection into the login page. This is why you need to manually upload a logo after configuration.

**Note:**  
If you are testing this feature, please provide some feedback in [#166](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/issues/166)
in any case - if you have errors or not. It would be nice to know about providers that do work already and those, that
might need some adoptions. All OIDC providers should work already, because for these we can rely on standards and RFCs,
but all others might produce some edge cases and I simply cannot test all of them myself.  
If we have new providers we know of, that need special values, these values would be helpful as well, because Rauthy
could provide a template in the UI for these in the future, so please let me know.

#### Auto Image Optimization

The whole logic how images are handled has been rewritten.
Up until v0.21.1, custom client logos have been taken as a Javascript `data:` url because of easier handling.
This means however, that we needed to allow `data:` sources in the CSP for `img-src`, which can be a security issue and
should be avoided if possible.

This whole handling and logic has been rewritten. The CSP hardening has been finalized by removing the `data:` allowance
for `img-src`. You can still upload SVG / JPG / PNG images under the client branding (and for the new auth providers).
In the backend, Rauthy will actually parse the image data, convert the images to the optimized `webp` format, scale
the original down and save 2 different versions of it. The first version will be saved internally to fit into 128x128px
for possible later use, the second one even smaller. The smaller version will be the one actually being displayed on
the login page for Clients and Auth Providers.  
This optimization reduces the payload sent to clients during the login by a lot, if the image has not been manually
optimized beforehand. Client Logos will typically be in the range of ~5kB now while the Auth Providers ones will usually
be less than 1kB.

[6ccc541](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/6ccc541b0e6d155024aa9ba4d832dcb01f135528)

#### Custom Header Name for extracting Client IPs

With the name config variable `PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME`, you can specify a custom header name which will be used for
extracting the clients IP address. For instance, if you are running Rauthy behind a Cloudflare proxy, you will usually
only see the IP of the proxy itself in the `X-FORWARDED-FOR` header. However, cloudflare adds a custom header called
`CF-Connecting-IP` to the request, which then shows the IP you are looking for.    
Since it is very important for rate limiting and blacklisting that Rauthy knows the clients IP, this can now be
customized.

```
# Can be set to extract the remote client peer IP from a custom header name
# instead of the default mechanisms. This is needed when you are running
# behind a proxy which does not set the `X-REAL-IP` or `X-FORWARDED-FOR` headers
# correctly, or for instance when you proxy your requests through a CDN like
# Cloudflare, which adds custom headers in this case.
# For instance, if your requests are proxied through cloudflare, your would
# set `CF-Connecting-IP`.
PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME="CF-Connecting-IP"
```

[a56c05e](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/a56c05e560c4b89f88f34240cb79a29e1e8a746c)

#### Additional Client Data: `contacts` and `client_uri`

For each client, you can now specify contacts and a URI, where the application is hosted. These values might be shown
to users during login in the future. For Rauthy itself, the values will be set with each restart in the internal
anti lockout rule. You can specify the contact via a new config variable:

```
# This contact information will be added to the `rauthy`client
# within the anti lockout rule with each new restart.
RAUTHY_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@localhost.de"
```

[6ccc541](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/6ccc541b0e6d155024aa9ba4d832dcb01f135528)

#### Custom `redirect_uri` During User Registration

If you want to initiate a user registration from a downstream app, you might not want your users to be redirected
to their Rauthy Account page after they have initially set the password. To encounter this, you can redirect them
to the registration page and append a `?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Frauthy.example.com` query param. This will be
saved in the backend state and the user will be redirected to this URL instead of their account after they have set
their password.

#### Password E-Mail Tempalte Overwrites

You can not overwrite the template i18n translations for the NewPassword and ResetPassword E-Mail templates.  
There is a whole nwe section in the config and it can be easily done with environment variables:

```
#####################################
############ TEMPLATES ##############

# You can overwrite some default email templating values here.
# If you want to modify the basic templates themselves, this is

## v0.21.0

### Breaking

The access token's `sub` claim had the email as value beforehand. This was actually a bug.  
The `sub` of access token and id token must be the exact same value. `sub` now correctly contains the user ID,
which is 100% stable, even if the user changes his email address.  
This means, if you used the `sub` from the access token before to get the users email, you need to pay attention now.
The `uid` from the access token has been dropped, because this value is now in `sub`. Additionally, since many
applications need the email anyway, it makes sense to have it inside the access token. For this purpose, if `email`
is in the requested `scope`, it will be mapped to the `email` claim in the access token.

### Features

#### OpenID Core Compatibility

Rauthy should now be compliant with the mandatory part of the OIDC spec.
A lot of additional things were already implemented many versions ago.
The missing thing was respecting some additional params during GET `/authorize`.

#### OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration

Rauthy now supports Dynamic Client registration as
defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html).

Dynamic clients will always get a random ID, starting with `dyn$`, followed by a random alphanumeric string,
so you can distinguish easily between them in the Admin UI.  
Whenever a dynamic client does a `PUT` on its own modification endpoint with the `registration_token` it
received from the registration, the `client_secret` and the `registration_token` will be rotated and the
response will contain new ones, even if no other value has been modified. This is the only "safe" way to
rotate secrets for dynamic clients in a fully automated manner. The secret expiration is not set on purpose,
because this could easily cause troubles, if not implemented properly on the client side.  
If you have a
badly implemented client that does not catch the secret rotation and only if you cannot fix this on the
client side, maybe because it's not under your control, you may deactivate the auto rotation with
`DYN_CLIENT_SECRET_AUTO_ROTATE=false`. Keep in mind, that this reduces the security level of all dynamic
clients.

Bot and spam protection is built-in as well in the best way I could think of. This is disabled, if you set
the registration endpoint to need a `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`. Even though this option exists for completeness,
it does not really make sense to me though. If you need to communicate a token beforehand, you could just
register the client directly. Dynamic clients are a tiny bit less performant than static ones, because we
need one extra database round trip on successful token creation to make the spam protection work.  
However, if you do not set a `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`, the registration endpoint would be just open to anyone.
To me, this is the only configuration for dynamic client registration, that makes sense, because only that
is truly dynamic. The problem then are of course bots and spammers, because they can easily fill your
database with junk clients. To counter this, Rauthy includes two mechanisms:

- hard rate limiting - After a dynamic client has been registered, another one can only be registered
  after 60 seconds (default, can be set with `DYN_CLIENT_RATE_LIMIT_SEC`) from the same public IP.
- auto-cleanup of unused clients - All clients, that have been registered but never used, will be deleted
  automatically 60 minutes after the registration (default, can be set with `DYN_CLIENT_CLEANUP_MINUTES`).

There is a whole new section in the config:

```
#####################################
########## DYNAMIC CLIENTS ##########
#####################################

# If set to `true`, dynamic client registration will be enabled.
# Only activate this, if you really need it and you know, what
# you are doing. The dynamic client registration without further
# restriction will allow anyone to register new clients, even
# bots and spammers, and this may create security issues, if not
# handled properly and your users just login blindly to any client
# they get redirected to.
# default: false
#ENABLE_DYN_CLIENT_REG=false

# If specified, this secret token will be expected during
# dynamic client registrations to be given as a
# `Bearer <DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN>` token. Needs to be communicated
# in advance.
# default: <empty>
#DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN=

# The default token lifetime in seconds for a dynamic client,
# that will be set during the registration.
# This value can be modified manually after registration via
# the Admin UI like for any other client.
# default: 1800
#DYN_CLIENT_DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIFETIME=1800

# If set to 'true', client secret and registration token will be
# automatically rotated each time a dynamic client updates itself
# via the PUT endpoint. This is the only way that secret rotation
# could be automated safely.
# However, this is not mandatory by RFC and it may lead to errors,
# if the dynamic clients are not implemented properly to check for
# and update their secrets after they have done a request.
# If you get into secret-problems with dynamic clients, you should
# update the client to check for new secrets, if this is under your
# control. If you cannot do anything about it, you might set this
# value to 'false' to disable secret rotation.
# default: true
#DYN_CLIENT_SECRET_AUTO_ROTATE=true

# This scheduler will be running in the background, if
# `ENABLE_DYN_CLIENT_REG=true`. It will auto-delete dynamic clients,
# that have been registered and not been used in the following
# `DYN_CLIENT_CLEANUP_THRES` hours.
# Since a dynamic client should be used right away, this should never
# be a problem with "real" clients, that are not bots or spammers.
#
# The interval is specified in minutes.
# default: 60
#DYN_CLIENT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=60

# The threshold for newly registered dynamic clients cleanup, if
# not being used within this timeframe. This is a helper to keep
# the database clean, if you are not using any `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`.
# The threshold should be specified in minutes. Any client, that has
# not been used within this time after the registration will be
# automatically deleted.
#
# Note: This scheduler will only run, if you have not set any
# `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`.
#
# default: 60
#DYN_CLIENT_CLEANUP_MINUTES=60

# The rate-limiter timeout for dynamic client registration.
# This is the timeout in seconds which will prevent an IP from
# registering another dynamic client, if no `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`
# is set. With a `DYN_CLIENT_REG_TOKEN`, the rate-limiter will not
# be applied.
# default: 60
#DYN_CLIENT_RATE_LIMIT_SEC=60
```

#### Better UX with respecting `login_hint`

This is a small UX improvement in some situations. If a downstream client needs a user to log in, and it knows
the users E-Mail address somehow, maybe because of an external initial registration, It may append the correct
value with appending the `login_hint` to the login redirect. If this is present, the login UI will pre-fill the
E-Mail input field with the given value, which make it one less step for the user to log in.

### Changes

- The `/userinfo` endpoint now correctly respects the `scope` claim from withing the given `Bearer` token
  and provides more information. Depending on the `scope`, it will show the additional user values that were
  introduced with v0.20

## v0.20.1

This is a small bugfix release.  
The temp migrations which exist for v0.20 only to migrate existing database secrets to
[cryptr](https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr) were causing a crash at startup for a fresh installation. This is the only
thing that has been fixed
with this version. They are now simply ignored and a warning is logged into the console at the very first startup.

## v0.20.0

### Breaking

This update is not backwards-compatible with any previous version. It will modify the database under the hood
which makes it incompatible with any previous version. If you need to downgrade for whatever reason, you will
only be able to do this by applying a database backup from an older version.
Testing has been done and everything was fine in tests. However, if you are using Rauthy in production, I recommend
taking a database backup, since any version <= v0.19 will not be working with a v0.20+ database.

### IMPORTANT Upgrade Notes

If you are upgrading from any earlier version, there is a manual action you need to perform, before you can
start v0.20.0. If this has not been done, it will simply panic early and not start up. Nothing will get damaged.

The internal encryption of certain values has been changed. Rauthy now uses [cryptr](https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr)
to handle these things,
like mentioned below as well.

However, to make working with encryption keys easier and provide higher entropy, the format has changed.
You need to convert your currently used `ENC_KEYS` to the new format:

#### Option 1: Use `cryptr` CLI

**1. Install cryptr - https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr**

If you have Rust available on your system, just execute:

  ```
  cargo install cryptr --features cli --locked
  ```

Otherwise, pre-built binaries do exist:

Linux: https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr/raw/main/out/cryptr_0.2.2

Windows: https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr/raw/main/out/cryptr_0.2.2.exe

**2. Execute:**

  ```
  cryptr keys convert legacy-string
  ```

**3. Paste your current ENC_KEYS into the command line.**

For instance, if you have

  ```
  ENC_KEYS="bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4 q6u26onRvXVG4427/3CEC8RJWBcMkrBMkRXgx65AmJsNTghSA"
  ```

in your config, paste

  ```
  bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4 q6u26onRvXVG4427/3CEC8RJWBcMkrBMkRXgx65AmJsNTghSA
  ```

If you provide your ENC_KEYS via a Kubernetes secret, you need to do a base64 decode first.
For instance, if your secret looks something like this

  ```
  ENC_KEYS: YlZDeVRzR2FnZ1Z5NXlxUS9TOW43b0NlbjUzeFNKTHpjc21mZG5CRHZOcnFRNjNyNCBxNnUyNm9uUnZYVkc0NDI3LzNDRUM4UkpXQmNNa3JCTWtSWGd4NjVBbUpzTlRnaFNB
  ```

Then decode via shell or any tool your like:

  ```
  echo -n YlZDeVRzR2FnZ1Z5NXlxUS9TOW43b0NlbjUzeFNKTHpjc21mZG5CRHZOcnFRNjNyNCBxNnUyNm9uUnZYVkc0NDI3LzNDRUM4UkpXQmNNa3JCTWtSWGd4NjVBbUpzTlRnaFNB | base64 -d
  ```

... and paste the decoded value into cryptr

**4. cryptr will output the correct format for either usage in config or as kubernetes secret again**

**5. Paste the new format into your Rauthy config / secret and restart.**

#### Option 2: Manual

Rauthy expects the `ENC_KEYS` now base64 encoded, and instead of separated by whitespace it expects them to
be separated by `\n` instead.  
If you don't want to use `cryptr` you need to convert your current keys manually.

For instance, if you have

```
ENC_KEYS="bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4 q6u26onRvXVG4427/3CEC8RJWBcMkrBMkRXgx65AmJsNTghSA"
```

in your config, you need to convert the enc key itself, the value after the `/`, to base64, and then separate
them with `\n`.

For instance, to convert `bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4`, split off the enc key part
`S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4` and encode it with base64:

```
echo -n 'S9n7oCen53xSJLzcsmfdnBDvNrqQ63r4' | base64
```

Then combine the result with the key id again to:

```
bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/UzluN29DZW41M3hTSkx6Y3NtZmRuQkR2TnJxUTYzcjQ=
```

Do this for every key you have. The `ENC_KEYS` should then look like this in the end:

```
ENC_KEYS="
bVCyTsGaggVy5yqQ/UzluN29DZW41M3hTSkx6Y3NtZmRuQkR2TnJxUTYzcjQ=
q6u26onRvXVG4427/M0NFQzhSSldCY01rckJNa1JYZ3g2NUFtSnNOVGdoU0E=
"
```

**Important:**  
Make sure to not add any newline characters or spaces when copying values around when doing the bas64 encoding!

### Encrypted SQLite backups to S3 storage

Rauthy can now push encrypted SQLite backups to a configured S3 bucket.
The local backups to `data/backups/` do still exist. If configured, Rauthy will now push backups from SQLite
to an S3 storage and encrypt them on the fly. All this happens with the help
of [cryptr](https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr)
which is a new crate of mine. Resource usage is minimal, even if the SQLite file would be multiple GB's big.
The whole operation is done with streaming.

### Auto-Restore SQLite backups

Rauthy can now automatically restore SQLite backups either from a backup inside `data/backups/` locally, or
fetch an encrypted backup from an S3 bucket. You only need to set the new `RESTORE_BACKUP` environment variable
at startup and Rauthy will do the rest. No manually copying files around.  
For instance, a local backup can be restored with setting `RESTORE_BACKUP=file:rauthy-backup-1703243039` and an
S3 backup with `RESTORE_BACKUP=s3:rauthy-0.20.0-1703243039.cryptr`.

### Test S3 config at startup

To not show unexpected behavior at runtime, Rauthy will initialize and test a configured S3 connection
at startup. If anything is not configured correctly, it will panic early. This way, when Rauthy starts
and the tests are successful, you know it will be working during the backup process at night as well, and
it will not crash and throw errors all night long, if you just had a typo somewhere.

### Migration to `spow`

The old (very naive) Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism for bot and spam protection has been migrated to make use
of the [spow](https://github.com/sebadob/spow) crate, which is another new project of mine.
With this implementation, the difficulty for PoW's a client must solve can be scaled up almost infinitely,
while the time is takes to verify a PoW on the server side will always be `O(1)`, no matter hoch high the
difficulty was. `spow` uses a modified version of the popular Hashcat PoW algorithm, which is also being used
in the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Separate users cache

A typical Rauthy deployment will have a finite amount of clients, roles, groups, scopes, and so on.
The only thing that might scale endlessly are the users. Because of this, the users are now being cached
inside their own separate cache, which can be configured and customized to fit the deployment's needs.
You can now set the upper limit and the lifespan for cached user's. This is one of the first upcoming
optimizations, since Rauthy gets closer to the first v1.0.0 release:

### E-Mails as lowercase only

Up until now, it was possible to register the same E-Mail address multiple times with using uppercase characters.
E-Mail is case-insensitive by definition though. This version does a migration of all currently existing E-Mail
addresses
in the database to lowercase only characters. From that point on, it will always convert any address to lowercase only
characters to avoid confusion and conflicts.  
This means, if you currently have the same address in your database with different casing, you need to resolve this
issue manually. The migration function will throw an error in the console at startup, if it finds such a conflict.

```
# The max cache size for users. If you can afford it memory-wise, make it possible to fit
# all active users inside the cache.
# The cache size you provide here should roughly match the amount of users you want to be able
# to cache actively. Depending on your setup (WebIDs, custom attributes, ...), this number
# will be multiplied internally  by 3 or 4 to create multiple cache entries for each user.
# default: 100
CACHE_USERS_SIZE=100

# The lifespan of the users cache in seconds. Cache eviction on updates will be handled automatically.
# default: 28800
CACHE_USERS_LIFESPAN=28800
```

### Additional claims available in ID tokens

The scope `profile` now additionally adds the following claims to the ID token (if they exist for the user):

- `locale`
- `birthdate`

The new scope `address` adds:

- `address` in JSON format

  The new scope `phone` adds:
- `phone`

### Changes

- new POST `/events` API endpoint which serves archived events
  [d5d4b01](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/d5d4b0145768982f20ebc1dbbfc568a73d7937bd)

- backend + frontend dependencies have been updated to the latest versions everywhere
- The internal encryption handling has been changed to a new project of mine
  called [cryptr](https://github.com/sebadob/cryptr).  
  This makes the whole value encryption way easier, more stable and future-proof, because values have their own
  tiny header data with the minimal amount of information needed. It not only simplifies encryption key rotations,
  but also even encryption algorithm encryptions really easy in the future.

## v0.19.1

This is a small bugfix and compatibility release regarding password reset E-Mails.

The main reason for this release are problems with the Password Reset via E-Mail when users
are using Microsoft (the only service provider where this problems can be replicated 100% of the time)
and / or Outlook. These users were unable to use password reset links at all.
The reason is a "Feature" from Microsoft. They fully scan the user's E-Mails and even follow all links
inside it. The problem is, that the binding cookie from Rauthy will go to the Microsoft servers instead
of the user, making is unusable and basically invalidating everything before the user has any chance to
use the link properly.

The usage of this config variable is **highly discouraged,** and you should **avoid it, if you can**.
However, big enterprises are moving slowly (and often not at all). This new config variable can be used
as a last resort, to make it usable by giving up some security.

```
# This value may be set to 'true' to disable the binding cookie checking
# when a user uses the password reset link from an E-Mail.
#
# When using such a link, you will get a so called binding cookie. This
# happens on the very first usage of such a reset link. From that moment on,
# you will only be able to access the password reset form with this very 
# device and browser. This is just another security mechanism and prevents
# someone else who might be passively sniffing network traffic to extract 
# the (unencrypted) URI from the header and just use it, before the user 
# has a change to fill out the form. This is a mechanism to prevent against
# account takeovers during a password reset.
#
# The problem however are companies (e.g. Microsoft) who scan their customers

```

### Changes

- implement `UNSAFE_NO_RESET_BINDING` like mentioned above

### Bugfixes

- It was possible to get an "Unauthorized Session" error during a password reset, if it has been
  initiated by an admin and / or from another browser.

- Correctly set `ML_LT_PWD_FIRST` - set the default value in minutes (like documented) instead
  of seconds. New default is `ML_LT_PWD_FIRST=4320`

## v0.19.0

### Solid OIDC Support

This is the main new feature for this release.

With the now accepted `RSA` signatures for DPoP tokens, the ephemeral, dynamic clients and
the basic serving of `webid` documents for each user, Rauthy should now fully support Solid OIDC.
This feature just needs some more real world testing with already existing applications though.

These 3 new features are all opt-in, because a default deployment of Rauthy will most probably
not use them at all. There is a whole new section in the [Config](https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/config/config.html)
called `EPHEMERAL CLIENTS` where you can configure these things. The 3 main variables you need
to set are:

```
# Can be set to 'true' to allow the dynamic client lookup via URLs as
# 'client_id's during authorization_code flow initiation.
# default: false
ENABLE_EPHEMERAL_CLIENTS=true

# Can be set to 'true' to enable WebID functionality like needed
# for things like Solid OIDC.
# default: false
ENABLE_WEB_ID=true

# If set to 'true', 'solid' will be added to the 'aud' claim from the ID token
# for ephemeral clients.
# default: false
ENABLE_SOLID_AUD=true
```

Afterward, the only "manual" thing you need to do is to add a custom scope called `webid`
once via the Admin UI.

### `EVENT_MATRIX_ERROR_NO_PANIC`

This new config variable solves a possible chicken and egg problem, if you use a self-hosted
Matrix server and Rauthy as its OIDC provider at the same time. If both services are offline,
for instance because of a server reboot, you would not be able to start them.

- The Matrix Server would panic because it cannot connect to and verify Rauthy
- Rauthy would panic because it cannot connect to Matrix

Setting this variable to `true` solves this issue and Rauthy would only log an error in that
case instead of panicking. The panic is the preferred behavior though, because this makes
100% sure that Rauthy will actually be able to send out notification to configured endpoints.

## v0.18.0

This is a rather small release.
The main reason it is coming so early is the license change.

### License Change To Apache 2.0

With this release, the license of Rauthy is changed from the AGPLv3 to an Apache 2.0.
The Apache is way more permissive and make the integration with other open source projects and software a lot easier.

### DPoP Token Support (Experimental)

The first steps towards DPoP Token support have been made.
It is marked as experimental though, because the other authentication methods have been tested and verified with
various real world applications already. This is not the case for DPoP yet.
Additionally, the only supported alg for DPoP proofs is EdDSA for now. The main reason being that I am using Jetbrains
IDE's and the Rust plugin for both IDEA and RustRover are currently broken in conjunction with the `rsa` crate
(and some others) which makes writing code with them a nightmare. RSA support is prepared as much as possible
though and I hope they will fix this bug soon, so it can be included.

If you have or use a DPoP application, I would really appreciate testing with Rauthy and to get some feedback, so I
can make the whole DPoP flow more resilient as well.

Please note that Authorization Code binding to a DPoP key is also not yet supported, only the `/token` endpoint accepts
and validates the `DPoP` header for now.

### Changes

## v0.17.0

This is a pretty huge update with a lot of new features.

### New Features

#### Support for `linux/arm64`

With the release of v0.17.0, Rauthy's container images are now multi-platform.

Both a `linux/amd64` and a `linux/arm64` are supported. This means you can "just use it" now on Raspberry Pi and
others, or on Ampere architecture from Cloud providers without the need to compile it yourself.

#### Events and Auditing

Rauthy now produces events in all different kinds of situations. These can be used for auditing, monitoring, and so on.
You can configure quite a lot for them in the new `EVENTS / AUDIT` section in the
[Rauthy Config](https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/config/config.html).

These events are persisted in the database, and they can be fetched in real time via a new Server Sent Events(SSE)
endpoint `/auth/v1/events/stream`. There is a new UI component in the Admin UI that uses the same events stream.
In case of a HA deployment, Rauthy will use one additional DB connection (all the time) from the connection pool
to distribute these events via pg listen / notify to the other members. This makes a much simpler deployment and
there is no real need to deploy additional resources like Nats or something like that. This keeps the setup easier
and therefore more fault-tolerant.

> You should at least set `EVENT_EMAIL` now, if you update from an older version.

#### Slack and Matrix Integrations

The new Events can be sent to a Slack Webhook or Matrix Server.

The Slack integration uses the simple (legacy) Slack Webhooks and can be configured with `EVENT_SLACK_WEBHOOK`:

```
# The Webhook for Slack Notifications.
# If left empty, no messages will be sent to Slack.
#EVENT_SLACK_WEBHOOK=
```

The Matrix integration can connect to a Matrix server and room. This setup requires you to provide a few more
variables:

```
# Matrix variables for event notifications.
# `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_ID` and `EVENT_MATRIX_ROOM_ID` are mandatory.
# Depending on your Matrix setup, additionally one of
# `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_PASSWORD` is needed.
# If you log in to Matrix with User + Password, you may use `EVENT_MATRIX_USER_PASSWORD`.
# If you log in via OIDC SSO (or just want to use a session token you can revoke),
# you should provide `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
# If both are given, the `EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` will be preferred.
#
# If left empty, no messages will be sent to Slack.
# Format: `@<user_id>:<server address>`
#EVENT_MATRIX_USER_ID=
# Format: `!<random string>:<server address>`
#EVENT_MATRIX_ROOM_ID=
#EVENT_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=
#EVENT_MATRIX_USER_PASSWORD=
# Optional path to a PEM Root CA certificate file for the Matrix client.
#EVENT_MATRIX_ROOT_CA_PATH=tls/root.cert.pem
# May be set to disable the TLS validation for the Matrix client.
# default: false
#EVENT_MATRIX_DANGER_DISABLE_TLS_VALIDATION=false
```

You can configure the minimum event level which would trigger it to be sent:

```
# The notification level for events. Works the same way as a logging level. For instance:
# 'notice' means send out a notifications for all events with the info level or higher.
# Possible values:
# - info
# - notice
# - warning
# - critical
#
# default: 'warning'
EVENT_NOTIFY_LEVEL_EMAIL=warning
# default: 'notice'
EVENT_NOTIFY_LEVEL_MATRIX=notice
# default: 'notice'
EVENT_NOTIFY_LEVEL_SLACK=notice
```

#### Increasing Login Timeouts

Up until version 0.16, a failed login would extend the time the client needed to wait for the result
artificially until it ended up in the region of the median time to log in successfully.
This was already a good thing to do to prevent username enumeration.
However, this has been improved a lot now.

When a client does too many invalid logins, the time he needs to wait until he may do another try
increases with each failed attempt. The important thing here is, that this is not bound to a user,
but instead to the clients IP.  
This makes sure, that an attacker cannot just lock a users account by doing invalid logins and therefore
kind of DoS the user. Additionally, Rauthy can detect Brute-Force or DoS attempts independently of
a users account.

There are certain thresholds at 7, 10, 15, 20, 25 invalid logins, when a clients IP will get fully
blacklisted (explained below) for a certain amount of time. This is a good DoS and even DDoS prevention.

#### Ip Blacklist Middleware

This is a new HTTP middleware which checks the clients IP against an internal blacklist.

This middleware is the very first thing that is being executed and just returns an HTML page
to a blacklisted client with the information about the blacklisting and the expiry.  
This blacklist is in-memory only to be as fast as possible to actually be able to handle brute
force and DoS attacks in the best way possible while consuming the least amount of resources
to do this.

Currently, IP's may get blacklisted in two ways:

- Automatically when exceeding the above-mentioned thresholds for invalid logins in a row
- Manually via the Admin UI

Blacklisted IP's always have an expiry and will get removed from the blacklist automatically.
Both actions will trigger one of the new Rauthy Events and send out notifications.

#### JWKS Auto-Rotate Scheduler

This is a simple new cron job which rotates the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) automatically for
enhanced security, just in case one of the keys may get leaked at some point.

By default, it runs every first day of the month. This can be adjusted in the config:

```
# JWKS auto rotate cronjob. This will (by default) rotate all JWKs every
# 1. day of the month. If you need smaller intervals, you may adjust this
# value. For security reasons, you cannot fully disable it.
# In a HA deployment, this job will only be executed on the current cache
# leader at that time.
# Format: "sec min hour day_of_month month day_of_week year"
# default: "0 30 3 1 * * *"
JWK_AUTOROTATE_CRON="0 30 3 1 * * *"
```

#### Fully Reworked Authentication Middleware

The authentication and authorization system has been fully reworked and improved.

The new middleware and way of checking the client's access rights in each endpoint is way
less error-prone than before. The whole process has been much simplified which indirectly
improves the security:

- CSRF Tokens are now checked automatically if the request method is any other than a `GET`
- `Bearer` Tokens are not allowed anymore to access the Admin API
- A new `ApiKey` token type has been added (explained below)
- Only a single authn/authz struct is needed to validate each endpoint
- The old permission extractor middleware was removed which also increases the performance a bit

#### New API-Key Type

This new API-Key type may be used, if you need to access Rauthy API from other applications.

Beforehand, you needed to create a "user" for an application, if you wanted to access the API,
which is kind of counter-intuitive and cumbersome.  
These new API-Keys can be used to handle this task now. These are static keys with an
optional expiry date and fine-grained access rights. You should only give them permissions
to the resources you actually need to further improve your backend security.

They can be easily created, configured and revoked / deleted in the Admin UI at any time.

> IMPORTANt: The API now cannot be accessed anymore with Bearer tokens! If you used this
> method until now, you need to switch to the new API Keys

#### OIDC Client FORCE_MFA feature

In the configuration for each individual OIDC client, you can find a new `FORCE MFA` switch.
It this new option is activated for a client, it will only issue authentication codes for
those users, that have at least one Passkey registered.  
This makes it possible to force MFA for all your different applications from Rauthy directly
without the need to check for the `amr` claim in the ID token and do or configure all of
this manually downstream. Most of the time, you may not even have control over the client
itself, and you are basically screwed, if the client does not have its own "force mfa integration".

> CAUTION: This mentioned in the UI as well, but when you check this new force mfa option,
> it can only force MFA for the `authorization_code` flow of course! If you use other flows,
> there just is no MFA that could be checked / forced.

#### Rauthy Version Checker

Since we do have an Events system now, there is a new scheduled cron job, which checks the
latest available Rauthy Version.

This Job runs once every 8 hours and does a single poll to the Github Releases API. It looks
for the latest available Rauthy Version that is not a prerelease or anything unstable.
If it finds a version higher than the currently running one, a new Event will be generated.
Additionally,
you will see the current Rauthy Version in the UI now and a small indicator just next to it,
if there is a stable update available.

### Removed

- The `ADMIN_ACCESS_SESSION_ONLY` config variable was removed. This was obsolete now with
  the introduction of the new ApiKey type.

## v0.16.1

This is a small bugfix release.  
If you had an active and valid session from a v0.15.0, did an update to v0.16.0 and your session was still valid,
it did not have valid information about the peer IP. This is mandatory for a new feature introduced with v0.16.0
though and the warning logging in that case had an unwrap for the remote IP (which can never be null from v0.16.0 on),
which then would panic.

This is a tiny bugfix release that just gets rid of the possible panic and prints `UNKNOWN` into the logs instead.

### Changes

- print `UNKNOWN` into the logs for non-readable / -existing peer IPs
  [6dfd0f4](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/6dfd0f4299b90c03d9b5a2fb4106d72f153146af)

## v0.16.0

### Breaking

This version does modify the database and is therefore not backwards compatible with any previous version.
If you need to downgrade vom v0.15 and above, you will only be able to do this via by applying a DB Backup.

### New Features

#### User Expiry

It is now possible to limit the lifetime of a user.  
You can set an optional expiry date and time for each user. This enables temporary access, for instance in
a support case where an external person needs access for a limited time.

Once a user has expired, a few things will happen:

- The user will not be able to log in anymore.
- As soon as the scheduler notices the expiry, it will automatically invalidate all possibly existing
  sessions and refresh tokens for this user. How often the scheduler will run can be configured with the
  `SCHED_USER_EXP_MINS` variable. The default is 'every 60 minutes' to have a good balance between security
  and resource usage. However, if you want this to be very strict, you can adjust this down to something like
  '5 minutes' for instance.
- If configured, expired users can be cleaned up automatically after the configured time.
  By default, expired users will not be cleaned up automatically. You can enable this feature with the
  ´SCHED_USER_EXP_DELETE_MINS` variable.

#### `WEBAUTHN_NO_PASSWORD_EXPIRY`

With this new config variable, you can define, if users with at least one valid registered passkey will
have expiring passwords (depending on the current password policy), or not.  
By default, these users do not need to renew their passwords like it is defined in the password policy.

#### Peer IP's for sessions -> `SESSION_VALIDATE_IP`

When a new session is being created, the peer / remote IP will be extracted and saved with the session
information. This peer IP can be checked with each access and the session can be rejected, if this IP
has changed, which will force the user to do a new login.

This will of course happen if a user is "on the road" and uses different wireless networks on the way,
but it prevents a session hijack and usage from another machine, if an attacker has full access to the
victims machine and even can steal the encrypted session cookie and(!) the csrf token saved inside the
local storage. This is very unlikely, since the attacker would need to have full access to the machine
anyway already, but it is just another security mechanism.

If this IP should be validated each time can be configured with the new `SESSION_VALIDATE_IP` variable.
By default, peer IP's will be validated and a different IP for an existing session will be rejected.

#### Prometheus metrics exporter

Rauthy starts up a second HTTP Server for prometheus metrics endpoint and (optional) SwaggerUI.
By default, the SwaggerUI from the `Docs` link in the Admin UI will not work anymore, unless you
specify the SwaggerUI via config to be publicly available. This just reduces the possible attack
surface by default.

New config variables are:

```
# To enable or disable the additional HTTP server to expose the /metrics endpoint
# default: true
#METRICS_ENABLE=true

# The IP address to listen on for the /metrics endpoint.
# You do not want to expose your metrics on a publicly reachable endpoint!
# default: 0.0.0.0
#METRICS_ADDR=0.0.0.0

# The post to listen on for the /metrics endpoint.
# You do not want to expose your metrics on a publicly reachable endpoint!
# default: 9090
#METRICS_PORT=9090

# If the Swagger UI should be served together with the /metrics route on the internal server.
# It it then reachable via:
# http://METRICS_ADDR:METRICS_PORT/docs/v1/swagger-ui/
# (default: true)
#SWAGGER_UI_INTERNAL=true

# If the Swagger UI should be served externally as well. This makes the link in the Admin UI work.
#
# CAUTION: The Swagger UI is open and does not require any login to be seen!
# Rauthy is open source, which means anyone could just download it and see on their own,
# but it may be a security concern to just expose less information.
# (default: false)
#SWAGGER_UI_EXTERNAL=false
```

#### User Verification status for Passkeys

For all registered passkeys, the User Verification (UV) state is now being saved and optionally checked.
You can see the status for each device with the new fingerprint icon behind its name in the UI.

New config variable:

```
# This feature can be set to 'true' to force User verification during the Webauthn ceremony.
# UV will be true, if the user does not only need to verify its presence by touching the key,
# but by also providing proof that he knows (or is) some secret via a PIN or biometric key for
# instance. With UV, we have a true MFA scenario where UV == false (user presence only) would
# be a 2FA scenario (with password).
#
# Be careful with this option, since Android and some special combinations of OS + browser to
# not support UV yet.
# (default: false)
#WEBAUTHN_FORCE_UV=true
```

#### Passkey Only Accounts

This is the biggest new feature for this release. It allows user accounts to be "passkey only".

A passkey only account does not have a password. It works only with registered passkeys with
forced additional User Verification (UV).

Take a look at the updated documentation for further information:  
[Passkey Only Accounts]https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/config/fido.html#passkey-only-accounts

#### New E-Mail verification flow

If an already existing user decides to change the E-Mail linked to the account, a new verification
flow will be started:

- A user changes the E-Mail in the Account view.
- The E-Mail will not be updated immediately, but:
    - A verification mail will be sent to the new address with an expiring magic link.
    - After the user clicked the link in the mail, the new address will be verified.
- Once a user verifies the new E-Mail:
    - The address will finally be updated in the users profile.
    - Information E-Mails about the change will be sent to the old and the new address

#### `EMAIL_SUB_PREFIX` config variable

This new variable allows you to add an E-Mail subject prefix to each mail that Rauthy sends out.
This makes it easier for external users to identify the email, what it is about and what it is
doing, in case the name 'Rauthy' does not mean anything to them.

```
# Will be used as the prefix for the E-Mail subject for each E-Mail that will be sent out to a client.
# This can be used to further customize your deployment.
# default: "Rauthy IAM"
EMAIL_SUB_PREFIX="Rauthy IAM"
```

#### New nicely looking error page template

In a few scenarios, for instance wrong client information for the authorization code flow or
a non-existing or expired magic link, Rauthy now does not return the generic JSON error response,
but actually a translated HTML page which informs the user in a nicer looking way about the problem.
This provides a way better user experience especially for all Magic Link related requests.

#### Rauhty DB Version check

This is an additional internal check which compares the version of the DB during startup and
the App version of Rauthy itself. This makes it possible to have way more stable and secure
migrations between versions in the future and helps prevent user error during upgrades.

### Changes

- legacy MFA app pieces and DB columns have been cleaned up

## v0.15.0

### Breaking

This version does modify the database and is therefore not backwards compatible with any previous version.
If you need to downgrade vom v0.15 and above, you will only be able to do this via by applying a DB Backup.

### Changes

This release is all about new Passkey Features.

- A user is not limited to just 2 keys anymore
- During registration, you can (and must) provide a name for the passkey, which helps you identify and distinguish
  your keys, when you register multiple ones.
- The `exclude_credentials` feature is now properly used and working. This makes sure, that you cannot register the
  same Passkey multiple times.
- The Passkeys / MFA section in the Admin UI has been split from the User Password section to be more convenient to use

## v0.14.5

This is the last v0.14 release.  
The next v0.15 will be an "in-between-release" which will do some migration preparations for Webauthn
/ FIDO 2 updates and features coming in the near future.

- Removed duplicate `sub` claims from JWT ID Tokens

## v0.14.4

This release mostly finishes the translation / i18n part of rauthy for now and adds some other
smaller improvements.  
Container Images will be published with ghcr.io as well from now on. Since I am on the free plan
here, storage is limited and too old versions will be deleted at some point in the future.
However, I will keep pushing all of them to docker hub as well, where you then should be able
to find older versions too. ghcr.io is just preferred, because it is not so hardly rate limited
than the docker hub free tier is.

- Added translations for E-Mails

## v0.13.1

This is just a small bugfix release.

- UI Bugfix: Client flow updates were not applied via UI
  [6fe8fbc](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/6fe8fbc1440498ea126a5aee5bed9dfe34e367d4)

## v0.13.0

- Improved container security: Rauthy is based off a Scratch container image by default now. This improved the security
  quite a lot, since you cannot even get a shell into the container anymore, and it reduced the image size by another
  ~4MB.  
  This makes it difficult however if you need to debug something, for instance when you use a SQLite deployment. For
  this reason, you can append `-debug` to a tag
  and you will get an Alpine based version just like before.
  [1a7e79d](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/commit/1a7e79dc96d27d8d180d1e4394644c8851cbdf70)
- More stable HA deployment: In some specific K8s HA deployments, the default HTTP2 keep-alive's from
  [redhac](https://github.com/sebadob/redhac) were not good enough and we got broken pipes in some environments which
  caused the leader to change often. This has been fixed
  in [redhac-0.6.0](https://github.com/sebadob/redhac/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
  too, which at the same time makes Rauthy HA really stable now.
- The client branding section in the UI has better responsiveness for smaller screens
