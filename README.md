# Rauthy

Rauthy - OpenID Connect Single Sign-On Identity & Access Management

## What it is

Rauthy is a lightweight and easy to use OpenID Connect Identity Provider. It aims to be simple to both set up and
operate, with very secure defaults and lots of config options, if you need the flexibility. It puts heavy emphasis on
Passkeys and a very strong security in general. The project is written in Rust to be as memory efficient, secure and
fast as possible, and it can run on basically any hardware. If you need Single Sign-On support for IoT or headless
CLI tools, it's got you covered as well.  
You get High-Availability, client branding, UI translation, a nice Admin UI, Events and Auditing, and many more
features. By default, it runs on top of [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) and does not depend on an external
database (Postgres as an alternative) to make it even simpler to operate, while scaling up to millions of users easily.

### Secure by default

It tries to be as secure as possible by default while still providing all the options needed to be compatible with
older systems. For instance, if you create a new OIDC client, it activates `ed25519` as the default algorithm for
token signing and S256 PKCE flow. This will not work with clients, which do not support it, but you can of course
deactivate this to your liking.

### MFA and Passwordless Login

**Option 1:**  
Password + Security Key (without User Verification):  
Rauthy provides FIDO 2 / Webauthn login flows. If you once logged in on a new client with your username + password,
you will get an encrypted cookie which will allow you to log in without a password from that moment on. You only need to
have a FIDO compliant Passkey being registered for your account.

**Option 2:**  
Passkey-Only Accounts:  
Rauthy supports Passkey-Only-Accounts: you basically just provide your E-Mail address and log in with
your FIDO 2 Passkey. Your account will not even have / need a password. This login flow is restricted though to only
those passkeys, that can provide User Verification (UV) to always have at least 2FA security.

> Discoverable credentials are discouraged with Rauthy (for good reason). This means you will need to enter your E-Mail
> for the login (which will be autofilled after the first one), but Rauthy passkeys do not use any storage on your
> device. For instance when you have a Yubikey which can store 25 passkeys, it will not use a single slot there even
> having full support.

### Fast and efficient

The main goal was to provide an SSO solution like Keycloak and others while using a way lower footprint and being more
efficient with resources. For instance, Rauthy can easily run a fully blown SSO provider on just a Raspberry Pi. It
makes extensive use of caching for everything used in the authentication chain to be as fast as possible. Most things
are even cached for several hours and special care has been taken into account in case of cache eviction and
invalidation.

Rauthy comes with two database options:

- with embedded [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite), which is the default setting
- or you can optionally use a Postgres as your database, if you already have an instance running anyway.

The resource usage depends a lot on your setup (Hiqlite, Postgres, HA deployment, amount of users, ...), but for a small
set of users, it is usually below 100mb of memory even with the very aggressive, in-memory caching Rauthy uses, and in
some cases even below 50mb.

### Highly Available

Even though it makes extensive use of caching, you can run it in HA mode. [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite)
creates its own embedded HA cache and persistence layer. Such a deployment is possible with
both [Hiqlite](https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) and Postgres.

### Admin UI + User Account Dashboard

Rauthy does have an Admin UI which can be used to basically do almost any operation you might need to administrate the
whole application and its users. There is also an account dashboard for each individual user, where users will get a
basic overview over their account and can self-manage som values, password, passkeys, and so on.

### Client Branding

You have a simple way to create a branding or stylized look for the Login page for each client. The whole color theme
can be changed and each client can have its own custom logo. Additionally, if you modify the branding for the default
`rauthy` client, it will not only change the look for the Login page, but also for the Account and Admin page.

### Events and Auditing

Rauthy comes with an Event- and Alerting-System. Events are generated in all kinds of scenarios. They can be sent via
E-Mail, Matrix or Slack, depending on the severity and the configured level. You will see them in the Admin UI in
real-time, or you can subscribe to the events stream and externally handle them depending on your own business logic.

### Brute-Force and basic DoS protection

Rauthy has brute-force and basic DoS protection for the login endpoint. The timeout will be artificially delayed after
enough invalid logins. It auto-blacklists IPs that exceeded too many invalid logins, with automatic expiry of the
blacklisting. You can, if you like, manually blacklist certain IPs as well via the Admin UI.

### IoT Ready

With the possibility to run on devices with very limited resources and having compatibility for the OAuth Device
Authorization Grant `device_code` flow, Rauthy would be a very good choice for IoT projects. The IdP itself can easily
run on a Raspberry Pi and all headless devices can be authenticated via the `device_code` flow. The `rauthy-client`
has everything built-in and ready, if you want to use Rust on the IoT devices as well. It has not been checked in a
`no_std` environment yet, but the client implementation is pretty simple.

### Scales to millions of users

Rauthy has no issue handling even millions of users. Everything keeps being fast and responsive, apart from the search
function for users in der Admin UI when you reach the 10+ million users, where searching usually takes ~3 seconds
(depending on your server of course).  
The only limiting factor at that point will be your configuration and needs for password hashing security. It really
depends on how many resources you want to use for hashing (more resources == more secure) and how many concurrent logins
at the exact same time you need to support.

## Getting Started

Either just take a look at the [Rauthy Book](https://sebadob.github.io/rauthy/), or start directly by taking a look at
the application yourself with docker on your localhost. Rauthy comes with a setting for very quick and easy local
testing and taking a first look. By setting `LOCAL_TEST=true`, a demo config is being loaded at startup.

```
docker run -it --rm -e LOCAL_TEST=true -p 8443:8443 ghcr.io/sebadob/rauthy:0.30.2
```

## Support

If you need professional (paid) support for Rauthy, please feel free to contact me at `mail@sebadob.dev`.
Otherwise, please use the Discussions Q&A section. Opened issues, which are actually just support requests, will
most probably not be answered at all. I am working on this project mostly in my free time.
