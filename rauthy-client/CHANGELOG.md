# Changelog

## UNRELEASED

- A new `struct ScimToken` has been added which can be used in SCIM endpoints to have an easy validation of the token
  without any manual work. It comes with an `axum` extractor and the usage is shown in the `axum` example. It is
  necessary
  on endpoints without any `Scim*` extractors like `GET /users/{id}` for instance.
- Some SCIM types also had changed values and some `Option<_>` values have been changed into non-optional, even if they
  are optional by the SCIM RFC. The reason they are made mandatory is, because Rauthy will reject request when some
  specific values do not exist. Other values like `_ref` in some situations have been removed completely, because Rauthy
  does not care about them at all, and they are unnecessary overhead.
- The `LogoutToken.sub` claims was not set properly as well in some situations and the value was missing completely.
- The `picture` claim that Rauthy sends by now has been added to `JwtIdClaims`.

## v0.9.0

### Breaking

The type of the `postal_code` in the `id_token` -> address claims has been changed from `i32` to `String`. This has
been changed with Rauthy `v0.30` for more compatibility.

## v0.8.0

### OIDC Backchannel Logout

There is a new feature `backchannel-logout` which enables compatibility with Backchannel Logout. You will be able to
accept and validate `LogoutToken`s and perform a Backchannel Logout.
The [axum Example](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/tree/main/rauthy-client/examples/axum) shows how to use it.

### SCIM

With the feature `scim` enabled, all SCIM-related types are included. The SCIM impl is only partial, but covers every
case / combination that Rauthy might send to a client. The above
mentioned [axum Example](https://github.com/sebadob/rauthy/tree/main/rauthy-client/examples/axum) shows an example
integration.

> Both new implementations (Backchannel Logout / SCIM) also bring API extractors for `axum` out of the box. There are
> not `actix-web` extractors yet.

## v0.7.0

### Breaking

The function signature for `OidcProviderConfig::setup_from_config()` now expects the `redirect_uri` as a `String`
instead of `&str`.

### Changes

External dependencies have been bumped, and the MSRV to `1.85.0`. `ring`, which is a pretty heavy-weight dependency, has
been dropped in favor of `sha2`. `ring` was used only for S256 PKCE hashes.

### Bugfix

- The `redirect_uri` during the `/token` request has been URL encoded, which should not be the case and could lead to
  errors like `invalid redirect_uri`

## v0.6.1

Fixes the `OptionalFromRequestParts` trait impl for `axum-0.8` in a way that it makes the example work
again as expected.

## v0.6.0

Brings compatibility for `axum-0.8` by bumping `axum` and `axum_extra` dependencies.

## v0.5.0

This version bumps internal dependencies and
remediates [CVE-2024-12224](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0421). The way the vulnerable `idna` crate has
been used can not lead to any security issues though.

The MSRV is also bumped to `1.71.1`.

## v0.4.0

### BREAKING

The `rauthy_client::init()` has been renamed to `rauthy_client::init_with()` and a new `rauthy_client::init()`
has been added which just uses safe defaults.

### Changes

- renamed `rauthy_client::init()` to `rauthy_client::init_with()` and added a new `rauthy_client::init()`
  with safe defaults
- added a new feature `device-code` which will make it possible to use the Device Authorization Grant flow
  with this client
- added a new feature `userinfo` which will provide an additional `fetch_userinfo()` fn for the `PrincipalOidc`

## v0.3.0

- Changes the `RauthyConfig` to now accept `ClaimMapping` for `admin_claim` and `user_claim`.
  This provides a lot more flexibility how user roles can be mapped without prior interaction on
  the server side.

## v0.2.0

- deprecated `uid` claim has been removed from the `id_token` and `uid` is not correctly mapped to `sub`
- internal API improvements to avoid future mistakes during maintenance
- dependency updates

## v0.1.0
