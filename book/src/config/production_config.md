# Production Config

If you want to go into production, the configuration from the Getting Started section is most probably not enough.

The best thing you could do is just taking a look at the [Reference Config](/config/config.html) and reading through
all the possible options.

However, this section will give you a head start with the minimum you should set up. Depending on if you started
with Docker or Kubernetes so far, some values might have been already set.
