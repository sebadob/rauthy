# If set to true, the `/userinfo` endpoint will do additional validations.
# The non-strict mode will fetch the user by id from the `sub` claim and make
# sure it still exists and is enabled. The strict validation will do additional
# database fetches and validates every possible value.
# Additionally, it will look up a possibly linked user device from the `did` claim
# and make sure it still exists. It will also extract the `client_id` the token
# has been originally issued for from the `azp` claim, fetch it and make sure it
# still exists and is enabled.
# If you don't need the extra validations, you can set this to `false` to
# save some resources, if your clients to a lot of `/userinfo` lookups.
# default: true
USERINFO_STRICT=true

# Can be set to `true` to disable authorization on `/oidc/introspect`.
# This should usually never be done, but since the auth on that endpoint is not
# really standardized, you may run into issues with your client app.
# If so, please open an issue about it.
# default: false
#DANGER_DISABLE_INTROSPECT_AUTH=false

# Can be used when 'OPEN_USER_REG=true' to restrict the domains for a registration. For instance, set it to

# If set to true, a violation inside the CSRF protection middleware based
# on Sec-* headers will block invalid requests. Usually you always want this

# experience any issues with an already existing Rauthy deployment.
# In future releases, it will not be possible the disable these blocks.
# default: true
#SEC_HEADER_BLOCK=true

# If set to 'true', this will validate the remote peer IP address with each request and compare it with the
# IP which was used during the initial session creation / login.
# If the IP is different, the session will be rejected.
# This is a security hardening and prevents stolen access credentials, for instance if an attacker might have
# copied the encrypted session cookie and the XSRF token from the local storage from a user. However, this event
# is really unlikely, since it may only happen if an attacker has direct access to the machine itself.
#
# If your users are using mobile networks and get new IP addresses all the time, this means they have to do a
# new login each time. This is no big deal at all with Webauthn / FIDO keys anyway and should not be a reason
# to deactivate this feature.
#
# Caution: If you are running behind a reverse proxy which does not provide the X-FORWARDED-FOR header correctly,
# or you have the PROXY_MODE in this config disabled, this feature will not work. You can validate the IPs for
# each session in the Admin UI. If these are correct, your setup is okay.

# (default: true)
#SESSION_VALIDATE_IP=true

# By default, Rauthy will log a warning into the logs, if an active password
# reset form is being access multiple times from different hosts. You can set
# this to `true` to actually block any following request after the initial one.
# This hardens the security of the password reset form a bit more, but will
# create problems with E-Mail providers like Microsoft, which cans the customers
# E-Mails and even uses links inside, which make them unusable with this set to
# true.
# This feature works by setting an encrypted cookie to the host whichever opens
# the password reset form for the very first time. All subsequent requests either
# need to provide that cookie or would otherwise be rejected.
#PASSWORD_RESET_COOKIE_BINDING=true

# Can be set to extract the remote client peer IP from a custom header name
# instead of the default mechanisms. This is needed when you are running
# behind a proxy which does not set the `X-REAL-IP` or `X-FORWARDED-FOR` headers
# correctly, or for instance when you proxy your requests through a CDN like
# Cloudflare, which adds custom headers in this case.

#PEER_IP_HEADER_NAME="CF-Connecting-IP"

# You can enable authn/authz headers which would be added to the response
# of the `/auth/v1/oidc/forward_auth` endpoint. With  `AUTH_HEADERS_ENABLE=true`,
# the headers below will be added to authenticated requests. These could

# You can set different security levels for Rauthy's cookies.

# In this case you might want to restrict to 'secure', which will then

# If set to 'true', Rauthy will bind the cookie to the `/auth` path.

# This only works when you are using a SQLite database!

# You can either restore a local backup, or an encrypted one from S3 storage.

# For restoring from a local backup, provide the folder name of the backup you want to restore.

# like this:
# RESTORE_BACKUP=file:rauthy-backup-TIMESTAMP
#
# If you want to restore an encrypted backup from S3 storage, you must provide the object
# name in the configured bucket. For instance, let's say we have an object named
# `rauthy-0.20.0-1703243039.cryptr` in our bucket, then the format would be
